            The Rosa and Arena families established Mount Cathedral Vineyards in 1995, at an elevation of 300m on the north face of Mt Cathedral. The first plantings were of 1.2ha of merlot and 0.8ha of chardonnay, followed by 2.5ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha of cabernet franc in 1996. No pesticides or systemic chemicals are used in the vineyard. Oscar Rosa, chief winemaker, has completed two TAFE courses in viticulture and winemaking, as well as a Bachelor of Wine Science course at CSU in 2002, and gained practical experience working at Yering Station in the late 90s. The 2009 Victorian bushfires miraculously spared the vineyard, but smoke taint meant no wine was made.
