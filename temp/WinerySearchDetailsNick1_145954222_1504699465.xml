            The Cox family are multi-generation residents of Burrundulla. In 2006 management of the shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, merlot and semillon passed to the seventh generation of Jeremy, Vincent, Rowan and Andrew, with Jeremy leading the way. The varietal mix in the vineyard has been expanded with viognier, petit verdot, tempranillo and sangiovese. The wines are made in two ranges: Heritage at the top, then GX.
