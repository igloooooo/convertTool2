            Im not sure whether there is a slight note of irony in the name, but Poverty Hill Wines brings together men who have had a long connection with the Eden Valley. Robert Buck owns a small vineyard on the ancient volcanic soils east of Springton, producing both shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. Next is Stuart Woodman, who owns the vineyard with the riesling that produced glorious wines in the early 1990s, and also has high quality, mature-vine cabernet sauvignon. Finally, there is John Eckert, who once worked at Saltram. He not only works as winemaker at Poverty Hill, but manages Rob Bucks vineyard and his own small block of young riesling in the highlands of Springton. Prolonged drought to 2009, with extreme black frosts down to 14 C at night, gave way to incessant rain that devastated the 2011 vintage. Poverty Hill indeed. (We await the 10 vintage, which should restore Poverty Hills rating.) Exports to the US, Hong Kong and NZ.
