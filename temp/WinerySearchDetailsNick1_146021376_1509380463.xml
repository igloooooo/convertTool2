            Rick and Julie Hobba purchased the Hansen Hilltops property in 2002. They have since engaged in an extensive rehabilitation program in the vineyard, which is starting to pay dividends. The plantings are 2ha of cabernet sauvignon, 1.5ha riesling, and 1ha each of chardonnay, shiraz and semillon.
