            Melbourne-educated Peter Buxton travelled across the Nullarbor over 40 years ago and settled on a bush block of 405 acres on the Hay River, 6km north of Wilson Inlet. For the first 10 years Peter worked for the Department of Agriculture in Albany, surveying several of the early vineyards in WA, and recognised the potential of his familys property. The vineyard (chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and semillon) is planted on north-facing blocks, the geological history of which stretches back 2 billion years.
