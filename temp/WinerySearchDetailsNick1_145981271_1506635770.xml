            Brian and Michelle Lowrie found a vineyard in the beautiful but seldom visited Upper Chapman Valley district of Margaret River in 2000. It had 2.7ha of cabernet sauvignon believed to have been planted in 1976, and 5ha of semillon and sauvignon blanc planted in the early 80s. Until 2010 the grapes were sold to other Margaret River wineries, but in that year the semillon and sauvignon blanc were vinified for Ibizan Wines, and had immediate and significant show success. The name, incidentally, comes from the two red cloud kelpies who have faithfully kept company with Brian and Michelle in the vineyard over the years. They resemble Egyptian Ibizan hounds who looked after the pharoahs, hence the Egyptian eye on the striking labels.
