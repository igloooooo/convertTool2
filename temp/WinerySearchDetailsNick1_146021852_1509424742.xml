            My association with the owners of Simon Whitlam  Andrew and Hady Simon, Nicholas and Judy Whitlam, and Grant Breen  dates back to the late 1970s, at which time I was a consultant to the Simons leading wine retail shop in Sydney, Camperdown Cellars. The association continued for a time after I moved to Melbourne in 83, but ceased altogether in 87 when Camperdown Cellars was sold, thereafter being merged with Arrowfield Wines. The Simon Whitlam label was part of the deal, and it passed through a number of corporate owners until 20 years later, when the original partners regained control of the business. It is a virtual winery, the grapes purchased and the wine contract-made. This reflects the combined marketing and financial expertise of the partners. Exports to New Caledonia and China.
