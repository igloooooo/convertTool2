            The name is doubtless derived from that of owners Julie and Grant White, but might cause raised eyebrows in clothing circles. The project developed from their lifelong love of wine; it started with a hobby vineyard (along with friends) in the Adelaide Hills, then more formal wine studies, then highly successful amateur winemaking. The Whites purchase grapes from major SA regions, bringing them to their suburban house to be fermented and pressed, and then storing the wine offsite in French and American oak until ready for bottling and sale.
