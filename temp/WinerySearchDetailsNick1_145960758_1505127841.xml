            Duane Coates has a Bachelor of Science, a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Oenology from Adelaide University; for good measure he completed the theory component of the Masters of Wine degree in 2005. Having made wine in various parts of the world, and in SA for a number of important brands, he is more than qualified to make and market the Coates wines. Nonetheless, his original intention was to simply make a single barrel of wine employing various philosophies and practices outside the mainstream, and with no intention of moving to commercial production. The key is organically grown grapes and the refusal to use additives and fining agents. A deliberately low level of new oak (20%) is part of the picture. Exports to the US, Canada, Germany and Sweden.
