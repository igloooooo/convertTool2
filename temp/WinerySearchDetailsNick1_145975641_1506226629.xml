            The full name of the business is Marschall Groom Cellars, a venture owned by David and Jeanette Marschall and their six children, and Daryl and Lisa Groom and their four children. Daryl was a highly regarded winemaker at Penfolds before he moved to Geyser Peak in California. Years of discussion between the families resulted in the purchase of a 35ha block of bare land adjacent to Penfolds 130-year-old Kalimna Vineyard. Shiraz was planted in 1997, giving its first vintage in 99, the wine blended with the output from two vineyards, one 100 years old, the other 50 years old. The next acquisition was an 8ha vineyard at Lenswood in the Adelaide Hills, planted to sauvignon blanc. In 2000, 3.2ha of zinfandel was planted on the Kalimna Bush Block. Not surprisingly, a substantial part of the production is exported to the US (and also to Canada, Hong Kong and Taiwan).
