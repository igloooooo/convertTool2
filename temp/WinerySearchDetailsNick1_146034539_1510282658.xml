            Ulithorne produces small quantities of red wines from selected parcels of grapes from a vineyard in McLaren Vale planted by Rose Kentishs father-in-law Frank Harrison over 40 years ago. Roses dream of making small-batch, high quality wines from exceptional grapegrowing regions around the world has taken her to France, where she has made a Vermentinu on the island of Corsica and a Rose in Provence under the Ulithorne label. The cellar door is located in a converted flour mill in Middleton. Exports to the UK, the US, The Netherlands, Malaysia and Korea.
