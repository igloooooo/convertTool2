            Richard Beniac purchased his property at Macedon after completing a part-time university viticulture course; he also conducted soil tests and collected weather data before deciding to take on the challenge of cool climate viticulture. The first plantings were 2.6ha of merlot, followed by 0.6ha each of shiraz and cabernet franc. Merlot was the first wine produced in 2004; followed in by Shiraz and Cabernet Franc.
