            Graham Upson commenced planting pinot noir, chardonnay, semillon, merlot, pinot meunier and sauvignon blanc in 1995 on one of the coolest and latest-ripening sites in WA. The limestone cellar door area has sweeping views out over the ocean and to the Stirling Ranges, and also sells Belgian chocolates. Graham makes the red wines, James Kellie (Harewood Estate) the whites. Exports to the UK, Denmark, Russia, Poland and Japan.
