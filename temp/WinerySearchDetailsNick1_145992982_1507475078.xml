            Elizabeth and Elvis Metelovski acquired Majors Lane Wines in 2010, inheriting a fully mature vineyard planted to shiraz, chardonnay, semillon, chambourcin and pinot gris. They say they are seeking to differentiate the wines by having each variety made by a winemaker with a track record for the variety in question. Thus Andrew Thomas is making the Semillon, David Hook the Pinot Grigio and Daniel Binet the Shiraz.
