            The Lester family began the development of Trappers Gully in 1998, bringing varied backgrounds with them. Clea Candy has the most directly relevant CV, as a qualified viticulturist and practised winemaker, and, according to the official history, mother, daughter and wife, and pretty much the instigator of all heated discussions. The families have progressively planted 1ha each of chenin blanc, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz. An onsite winery was built prior to the 04 vintage.
