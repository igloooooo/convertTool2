            In 2007 Dr David Yates, with a background based on a degree in chemistry, purchased the pinot noironly Prince Albert vineyard from founder Bruce Hyett. David spends 612 months running the vineyard and winery, with advice from Bruce on winemaking and Steve Jones in the vineyard. So far as the latter is concerned, David is firmly committed to retaining the certified organic status for Prince Albert, and at this juncture sees no reason to change the style of the wine, which he has always loved. Exports to the UK.
