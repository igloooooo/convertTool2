            Marienberg (founded by Australias first female owner/vigneron, Ursula Pridham), along with Fern Hill Estate and Basedow (see separate entry), became part of the James Estate empire in 2003. A revamping of the packaging and labelling, plus acquisition of grapes from the Adelaide Hills to supplement those from McLaren Vale, has been accompanied by a move away from retail to restaurant/on-premise sales. The Marienberg Centre includes a restored 1850s cottage that incorporates the cellar door, wine bar and Limeburners Restaurant. Exports to Canada.
