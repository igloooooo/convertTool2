            Marie McDonald and Rick Stockdale purchased the property on which they have since established their vineyard, cellar door and restaurant in 1997. Pinot gris and tempranillo have been progressively planted, with other varieties purchased from local growers. The caf (and surrounding vineyard) is situated on a northeast-facing slope with spectacular views out to the Baw Baw Ranges.
