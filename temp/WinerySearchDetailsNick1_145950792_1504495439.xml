            Borambola Homestead was built in the 1880s, and in the latter part of that century was the centre of a pastoral empire of 1.4 million ha, ownership of which passed to the McMullen family in 1992. It is situated in rolling foothills 25km east of Wagga Wagga in the Gundagai region. The vineyards surround the homestead and include shiraz (4.5ha), cabernet sauvignon (3.5ha) and chardonnay (2ha). Exports to the US, Norway, Denmark, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and China.
