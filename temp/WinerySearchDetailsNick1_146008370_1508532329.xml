            Peppin Ridge is planted on the shores of Lake Eildon; the land forms part of a vast station property established in 1850, and now partly under Lake Eildon. The property was acquired by the Peppin family, who developed the Peppin Merino sheep, said to be the cornerstone of the Australian wool industry. The plantings of marsanne, verdelho, shiraz and merlot cover 4 ha.
