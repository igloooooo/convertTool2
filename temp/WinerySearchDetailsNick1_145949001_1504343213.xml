            The Pagano familys forebears made wine on the foothills of Mt Etna for many generations, and the family has been involved in the Australian wine industry for over 40 years. But it was not until 13 years ago that father Sebastian and wife Maria Pagano saw the Maleny area with its Glasshouse Mountain and surrounding Blackall Range, reminiscent of a scaled-down Mt Etna. They have now planted 4ha of chambourcin, and opened a tasting room (in the shape of a giant barrel) which sells a wide range of wines sourced from elsewhere in Australia. In best Qld tradition, there are plenty of attractions for tourists, including vineyard tours, focaccia lunches MonSat, and a continental buffet lunch on Sunday.
