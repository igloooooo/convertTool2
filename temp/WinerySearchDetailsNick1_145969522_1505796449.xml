            The establishment date of 2002 might, with a little poetic licence, be shown as 1864. Bryce Lillecrapp is the fifth generation of the Lillecrapp family; his great-great-great-grandfather bought land in the Eden Valley in 1864, subdividing it in 1866, establishing the township of Eden Valley and building the first house, Rushlea Homestead. Bryce restored this building and opened it in 1998 as a bicentennial project; it now serves as Fernfield Wines cellar door. He heads up Fernfield as grapegrower, with his wife Bronwyn chief winemaker, son Shannon cellar hand and assistant winemaker, and daughter Rebecca the wine marketer. While all members of the family have married grapegrowing and winemaking with other vocations, they have moved inexorably back to Fernfield, where they have vines dating back three generations of the family (riesling, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot, cabernet sauvignon, traminer and cabernet franc).
