            Hyde Park Wines is owned by David Wells, Michael Ramsden and Michael Tilley, who planted their large vineyard in 1997, close to the Seppelt vineyards at Great Western. Seventy per cent of the plantings are shiraz (the balance cabernet sauvignon and merlot) and only 10 tonnes of the annual production are kept for the Hyde Park brand. A super-premium Shiraz is made each year, and, when the quality is appropriately high, a smaller amount of Cabernet Merlot is made. The wines spend 12 months in French oak before being bottled and held for two years prior to sale.
