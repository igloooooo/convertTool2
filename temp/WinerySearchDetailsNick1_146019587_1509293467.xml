            Secret Garden Wines is owned by Ian and Carol MacRae, and is a sister operation to their main business, Miramar Wines. Estate plantings consist of 10ha of shiraz and around 2ha each of cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. The wines are made at Miramar, the cellar door is at Secret Garden. The property is only 5km from Mudgee and fronts Craigmoor Road, giving it a prime position in the so-called golden triangle.
