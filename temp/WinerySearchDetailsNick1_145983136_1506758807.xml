            Rob and Kay Howell, ownerfounders of Jeir Creek, celebrated 25 years of involvement in 2009. Rob runs the technically advanced winery, while Kay looks after the cellar door. Predominantly an estate-based business, the plantings comprise chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon (2ha each), riesling, sauvignon blanc, shiraz (1ha each) and smaller plantings of pinot noir, viognier and muscat.
