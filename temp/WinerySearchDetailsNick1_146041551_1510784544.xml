            Greg and Jady Roberts have sold their vineyard and winery at Wonga Park in the Yarra Valley and moved to a luxury residence in the Strathbogie Ranges. The house, known as Strath Hill, dating back to 1910, is set on 20 acres and surrounded by gardens, covered gazebo, reflection pools and fountains, making it an ideal wedding venue. Two B&amp;B cottages are also available. The Roberts do not intend to plant vines on the property,but will make wine from the Yarra Valley, Heathcote and the Strathbogie Ranges. A name change from Wonga Estate to Strath Hill is being considered. Exports to China.
