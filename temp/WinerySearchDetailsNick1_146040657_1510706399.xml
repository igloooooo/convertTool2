            Windowrie Estate was established by the ODea family in 1988 on a substantial grazing property at Canowindra, 30km north of Cowra and in the same viticultural region. A portion of the grapes from the substantial vineyard is sold to other makers, but increasing quantities are being made for the Windowrie Estate and The Mill labels; the Chardonnays have enjoyed show success. The cellar door is in a flour mill built in 1861 from local granite. It ceased operations in 1905 and lay unoccupied for 91 years until restored by the ODea family. Exports to China, Japan and Singapore
