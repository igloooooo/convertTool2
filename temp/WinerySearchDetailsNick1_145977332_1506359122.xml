            This is the venture of long-term Brokenwood partner and peripatetic wine consultant Nick Bulleid. It has been a slowly, slowly venture, with all sorts of obstacles along the way, with 1ha of pinot noir planted between 1996 and 99, but part thereafter grafted to a better clone, resulting in a clonal mix of MV6 (predominant) with two rows of clone 777 and a few vines of clone 115. The wines are made at Brokenwood under the joint direction of PJ Charteris and Nick, and are available though the website.
