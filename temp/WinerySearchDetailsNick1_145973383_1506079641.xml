            The origins of Glenmaggie go back to 1983, when trial plantings of shiraz and cabernet were sufficiently encouraging to prompt the extension of the vineyard to 3ha (0.5ha each of chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon). It is the venture of Fleur and Tony Dawkins, with occasional assistance from their young son Jack (who at the age of 8 graduated to supervision and grape quality assessment, other vineyard tasks being too menial).
