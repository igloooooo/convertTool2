            Ross Virgara spent much of his life in the broader food and wine industry, taking the plunge into commercial winemaking in 2006. The grapes come from a fourth-generation family property in the Lyndoch Valley, and the aim is to make fruit-driven styles of quality wine. His fondness for frontignac led to the first release of Moscato, followed in due course by Rose, Merlot Cabernet and Old Bush Vine Grenache. Exports to China.
