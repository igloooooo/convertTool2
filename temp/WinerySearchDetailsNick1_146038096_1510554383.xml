            Owners Diane and Gordon Davies say, We are different. Were original, were bold, were innovative. This is all reflected in the design of the unusual back labels (incorporating pictures of the innumerable pairs of braces that real estate agent Gordon wears at work in Perth), in the early move to screwcaps for both white and red wine, and, for that matter, in the underground trickle irrigation system (plus a move towards organic methods) in their Margaret River vineyard that can be controlled from Perth. Exports to Hong Kong, China and Singapore.
