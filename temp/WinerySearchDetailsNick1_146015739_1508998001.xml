            Roche Wines, with its 45ha of semillon, shiraz and chardonnay (plus a few bits and pieces), is but the tip of the iceberg of the massive investment made by Bill Roche in the Pokolbin subregion. He has transformed the old Hungerford Hill on the corner of Broke and McDonalds roads, and built a luxurious resort hotel with extensive gardens and an Irish pub on the old Tallawanta Vineyard, as well as resuscitating the vines on Tallawanta. The wines are all sold through the various outlets in the overall development; excess grapes are sold to other makers.
