            Joseph and Lena Birti began planting their vineyard, situated in a natural amphitheatre 12km from the Kiewa River, halfway between Myrtleford and Mt Beauty, in 1989. Thermal breezes rising from the Kiewa River valley help protect the vines from fungal disease, and the Birtis do not use any pesticides. From the word go has offered preservative-free alternatives.
