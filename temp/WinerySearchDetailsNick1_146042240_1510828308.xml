            Ian and Jo Zander are third-generation grapegrowers on the 200ha Wroxton Grange property, which was established in 1845 in the high country of the Eden Valley. The Zander family purchased the property in 1920, and planted their first vines that year; since 73 an extensive planting program has seen the progressive establishment of riesling (15.4ha), shiraz (10.5ha), chardonnay (6.9ha), semillon (2.5ha) and traminer (2ha). The majority of the grapes are sold, the best parcels from the mature vineyards retained to produce single-vineyard wines.
