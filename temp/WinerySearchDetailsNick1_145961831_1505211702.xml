            Having worked with Andrew Thomas at Thomas Wines for six years, Phillip LeMessurier has taken the next step by establishing Corduroy and making his own wines from single vineyards, the first vintage being made in 2009. The quality of the wines is exemplary, underscoring the skills learnt at Thomas Wines, and the quality of the vineyards from which the grapes have been purchased.
