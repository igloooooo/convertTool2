            Oxford Landing Estate is, so the website tells us, A real place, a real vineyard. A place distinguished by clear blue skies, rich red soil and an abundance of golden sunshine. In the 50+ years since the vineyard was planted, the brand has grown to reach all corners of the world. Success has been due to over-delivery against expectations at its price points, and it has largely escaped the scorn of the UK wine press. In 2008 a five-year experiment began to determine whether a block of vines could survive and produce an annual crop with only 10% of the normal irrigation. This apart, there is now 1ha of native vegetation for every ha of vineyard. Outstanding new packaging with custom-made, branded bottles in 11. Exports to the UK, the US and NZ.
