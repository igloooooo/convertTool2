            In 1998 Simon Hackett acquired the former Taranga winery in McLaren Vale, which has made his winemaking life a great deal easier. He purchases grapes from long-term contract growers in McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley, with a total of 40 ha. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
