            Nicolaas (Nico) and wife Shawn Duynhoven left Sydney and purchased their block of land because we wanted to grow something. Nico built the house and cellar door/caf, and they initially planted 280 hazelnut trees, followed by a little merlot and (progressively) 1ha each of riesling, sauvignon blanc and pinot noir. They achieved all this while holding down full-time jobs, Nico in home building and Shawn in nursing. By producing a Sauvignon Blanc, a Wooded Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Sparkling Merlot and Riesling Ice Wine, they have managed to expand the range of their wine portfolio notwithstanding its small estate-grown basis.
