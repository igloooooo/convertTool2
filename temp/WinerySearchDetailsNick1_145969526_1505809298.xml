            The names of the wines point to the involvement of owners David Roe and Les Lithgow in the film industry. Theirs is a virtual winery (likewise appropriate to the cinema), the wines made by the hugely experienced Geoff Weaver from high quality, contract-grown grapes. David becomes involved in vintage, but it is otherwise long-distance winemaking from the directors studio in Sydney. It should come as no surprise to find the wines are of high quality. Exports to the US, Canada and the Far East.
