            Zeppelin wines are made by Artisans of the Barossa winemakers Corey Ryan and Kym Teusner. They are sourced from vineyards either owned by Teusner or Sons of Eden, selected for their age (up to 80 years old), low yield and character. Marketing and distribution is carried out by Echelon Wine Partners, ultimate owners of the business.
