            The former Langbrook Estate vineyard, now renamed, is owned by Kevin Dixon and Graham Smith. It has pinot noir, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot gris and merlot, and the Sauvignon Blanc, in particular, has had significant show success. Shiraz (made from contract-grown grapes) has been added to the range.
