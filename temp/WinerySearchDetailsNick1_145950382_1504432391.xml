            Blind Man’s Bluff Vineyards is situated 45 mins from Qld’s Sunshine Coast. Noel Evans’ dream of establishing a vineyard, with his partner Tricia Toussaint and family members, turned into reality in 2001 when the property was planted to chardonnay and shiraz. Various cellar door activities have made the winery a state finalist for tourism.
