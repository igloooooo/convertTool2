            This AbbeyVale is a completely different business from that which operated prior to 2003, when a 19-member grower group contributed $1.25 million for start-up capital, coupled with grape supply agreements. Well-known and highly-skilled vigneron Philip May heads the operation (indeed he is the only director) and the services of 2 equally skilled and experienced winemaking consultants, Richard Rowe and Bruce Dukes, have been secured.
