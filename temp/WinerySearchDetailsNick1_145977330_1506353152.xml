            Established in 1988 by Mark and Wendy Hastwell and Martin and Jill Lightfoot with a focus on growing quality grapes for McLaren Vale wineries, it has now expanded to 16ha of vines and olive trees. Having initially sold much of the production, they have made a significant commitment to the Hastwell &amp; Lightfoot brand, producing wines from estate-grown varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Cabernet Franc, Tempranillo, Chardonnay and Viognier). The vines are grafted onto devigorating American rootstocks that restrain the development of dead fruit characters in warmer seasons. James Hastwell, son of Mark and Wendy, has his winery just 2kms from the vineyard, which means that fruit is moved quickly into the winery. Ferments are conducted in 2- and 3-tonne temperature-controlled open fermenters. Exports to the UK, Canada, Norway, Germany, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and China.
