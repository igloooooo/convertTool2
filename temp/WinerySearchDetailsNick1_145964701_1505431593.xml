            The establishment of Dinny Goonan dates back to 1988 when Dinny bought a 20ha property near Bambra, in the hinterland of the Otway Coast. Dinny had recently completed a viticulture diploma at CSU, and initially a wide range of varieties was planted in what is now known as the Nursery Block,to establish those best suited to the area. As these came into production Dinny headed back to CSU, where he completed a wine science degree. Ultimately, it was decided to focus production on shiraz and riesling, with more extensive planting of these varieties. In 07 a sticky block was added (semillon, sauvignon blanc), with the first harvest in 11.
