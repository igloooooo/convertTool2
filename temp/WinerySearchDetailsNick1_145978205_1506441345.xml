            This is a somewhat unusual venture involving a partnership between Adelaide-based Carmine De Ieso and Kuala Lumpur-based expatriates Kym Mensforth and James Coathup. The Henry Martin name is that of the founder of Stonyfell Winery, in 1858; the De Ieso family have been running the Drumminor Restaurant and the Stonyfell winery complex for many decades. It is hard to claim an establishment date of 1858, but Carmine De Ieso has been making Sparkling Shiraz for 20 years and maturing barrels of fortified wines. The budget-priced wines include Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Rose, Unwooded Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Late Picked Sauvignon Blanc and Sparkling Shiraz plus aged Port and Muscat. The majority of the production is exported to Malaysia and Vietnam, and also to Japan, Poland, Singapore and China.
