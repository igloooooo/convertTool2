            The 2.6ha Windy Ridge Vineyard was planted between 1978 and 86, with the first vintage taking place in 88. Graeme Wilson favours prolonged maturation, part in stainless steel and part in oak, before bottling his wines, typically giving the Pinot Noir three years and the Cabernet two years. One gets the feeling the wines would be far better if bottled earlier, the Pinot two years earlier.
