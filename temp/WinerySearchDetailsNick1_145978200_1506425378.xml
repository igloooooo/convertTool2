            Hans Henkell started with a 57-variety Heinz mix in the vineyard, but has now rationalised it to a total of 25 ha of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. Most of the grapes are sold, with small amounts contract-made each year. A change of ownership in late 2006 will not lead to any major changes in the operation of the business.
