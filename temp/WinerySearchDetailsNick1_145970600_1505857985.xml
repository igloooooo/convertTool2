            A group of 20 shareholders acquired the 130ha property on which the Flying Fish Cove winery was subsequently built. It has two strings to its bow: contract winemaking for others, and the development of its own brand, partly based on 25ha of estate plantings, with another 10ha planned. Exports to the US and Singapore.
