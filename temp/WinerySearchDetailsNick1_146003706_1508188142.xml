            Peter and Jill Bothe purchased the Nintingbool property in 1982 and built the home in which they now live in 84, using old bluestone dating back to the goldrush period. They established an extensive Australian native garden and home orchard, but in 98 diversified with the planting of pinot noir, a further planting the following year lifting the total to 2 ha; a small amount of the property remains to be planted with pinot gris. This is one of the coolest mainland regions, and demands absolute attention to detail (and a warm growing season) for success. In 2002 and 03 the grapes were sold to Ian Watson, the wine made and released under the Tomboy Hill label but with the Nintingbool Vineyard shown on the label (the 02 was quite a beautiful wine). In 04 they decided to make the wines themselves, the opening vintage producing a tiny 44 dozen.
