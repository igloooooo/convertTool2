            Peels icon wine is the Shiraz, a wine of considerable finesse and with a remarkably consistent track record. Every year Will Nairn holds a Great Shiraz Tasting for six-year-old Australian shirazs, and pits Peel Estate (in a blind tasting attended by 100 or so people) against Australias best. It is never disgraced. The wood-matured Chenin Blanc is another winery specialty, although not achieving the excellence of the Shiraz. Exports to the UK, Ireland, China and Japan.
