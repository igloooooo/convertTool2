            This is the venture of luxuriantly bearded Mark Creed. The first wine (an intriguing blend of shiraz, cabernet franc and viognier) was made in 2004, with a number of different Shirazs, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Grenache. Prior to the 2007 vintage a small winery was built, and in mid-2008 the cellar door moved to the Lyndoch Hill Retreat complex, which includes a restaurant, accommodation, conference facilities and garden. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Phillipines, Malaysia, China and NZ.
