            Tony Moodys great-grandfather started a retail chain of shops in Merseyside, England, under the banner Moodys Wines. The business was ultimately sold in 1965 to a brewery seeking to minimise off-licence competition. Tony planted 1ha of shiraz in a promising sheep paddock in 2000, and has subsequently added 1ha of sauvignon blanc.
