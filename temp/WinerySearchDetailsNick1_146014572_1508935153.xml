            The first vines were planted in 1992, and there are now a little over 4ha on the hillside slopes. Most of the grapes were sold, but founder Ron Collings made small batches of wine himself each year, which ultimately led to the decision to establish the Ridgeback label. The winery was sold to Sean Dixon and Kylie Dunscombe in 2006. Exports to the UK, Indonesia and Fiji.
