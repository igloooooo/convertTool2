            Former Professor of Optometry Leon Garner, and artist wife Rosie, returned to Australia in 2005 after living in NZ since 1979. They intended to settle in Qld, but by pure chance while driving along the Longwood-Mansfield Road, they noticed a for sale sign. The granite house was called Roseleigh (an eerie coincidence) and  when the surrounding scenery was considered  it was too hard to resist. Having purchased the house, they quickly formed a close friendship with Jenny Houghton of neighbouring Maygars Hill Winery, and she provided them with sufficient cuttings to plant 1.8ha of shiraz. Their first vintage followed in 2008.
