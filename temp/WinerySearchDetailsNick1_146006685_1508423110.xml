            Gary and Judy Surman bought Parnassus Guest House in 1989, developing a function centre specialising in weddings and conferences. Wishing to take further advantage of the great views, the Surmans planted 1ha each of pinot noir and chardonnay in 1998. In 2005 they purchased Wild Dog Winery, where their son Luke and Japanese wife Kunie manage the 12ha vineyard, the cellar door and assist in the winery. Mal Stewart has the same wide-ranging brief for Parnassus as he has for Wild Dog.
