            Roger Morgan purchased the Kara Gola vineyard (Aboriginal for distant views) in 1987. The original 1971 plantings (cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir) were extended in 89 (pinot noir), 91 (cabernet sauvignon and merlot) and 94 (chardonnay) and now total 4.8 ha. Roger completed a wine science degree at CSU in 1997 and wife Ally retired from teaching in 2004 to become the marketing and events manager. Heathcote Shiraz was recently added to the product range, and they continue to make elegant and distinctive wines.
