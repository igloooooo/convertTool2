            The ancestors of Michael and Alisa Hart arrived in SA in 1845, their earlier address (with seven children) was a hollow tree on the banks of the North Para River. Michael and Alisa personally tend the vineyard, which is the oldest certified organic vineyard in the Barossa Valley, and includes a patch of 110-year-old shiraz. The quality of the wines coming from these vines is exceptional; unfortunately there is only enough to fill two hogsheads a year (66 dozen bottles). The other wines made are also impressive, particularly given their prices.
