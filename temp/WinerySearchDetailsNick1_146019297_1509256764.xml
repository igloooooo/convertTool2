            The economical name is appropriate for a business that started with 1 tonne of grapes making two hogsheads of wine in 2001. The shiraz was purchased from Jason Schwarzs parents vineyard in Bethany, the vines planted 60 years ago; the following year half a tonne of grenache was added, once again purchased from the parents. Production remained static until 05, when the grape sale agreements to another (larger) winery were terminated, freeing up 1.8ha of shiraz and 0.8ha of grenache. From this point on things moved more quickly: in 06 Jason, while working with Peter Schell of Spinifex, formed a partnership (Biscay Road Vintners) with Peter giving each total control over production. Using grapes purchased from other growers, Jason hopes to eventually increase production to 30004000 dozen. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, France, Denmark, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
