            Owners and winemakers Andrew and Sandra Whytcross both undertook a two-year winemaking course through the Bendigo TAFE; with assistance from son Marty, they also look after the vineyard, which is planted to shiraz (3ha), cabernet sauvignon (1.9ha), and semillon and chardonnay (0.4ha each). The red wines are made in typical small-batch fashion with hand-picked fruit, hand-plunged fermenters and a basket press.
