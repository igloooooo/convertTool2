            Wayne and Sally Burgoyne with John and Karen Butler purchased the three-year-old vineyard in 2001, with 2ha of shiraz that had been planted by Paul Burgoyne (Waynes cousin), who continues to be involved with the operation as viticulturist. Merlot (0.8ha), viognier and sangiovese (0.4ha each) have been progressively added.
