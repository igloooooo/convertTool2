            Hans and Ulrike Zimmermann have a 10ha property in the southern end of McLaren Vale in the Willunga Hills, with a small winter creek running through. It took a considerable time for the organically-grown shiraz, planted on a granite, limestone and clay soil, to come into bearing. The first commercial wine was made in 1998, and the cellar door opened to the public, along with The Blue Grape B&amp;B. Exports to Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
