            When Joanne and Peter Gunn purchased the 17ha property now known as White Dog Farm, it had first been used for forestry timber, and, once the trees were gone, planted to cereal crops. Within a year of purchasing the property (named in honour of their former dog) they had begun planting 1.5ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha of merlot plus 400 olive trees with five different varieties used to produce the estate olive oil.
