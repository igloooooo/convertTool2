            Tizzana has been a weekend and holiday occupation for Peter Auld for many years now. It operates in one of the great historic wineries, built (in 1887) by Australias true renaissance man, Dr Thomas Fiaschi. The wines may not be great, but the ambience is. Moreover, vines have been replanted on the same vineyard as that first planted by Fiaschi in 1885 (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, aleatico, tannat and petit verdot). Peter has also developed Tizzana as a wine education centre.
