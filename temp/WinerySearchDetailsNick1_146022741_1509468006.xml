            Smithbrook was a major player in the Pemberton region, with almost 58ha of vines in production. In 2009 the Lion Nathan wine group sold the vineyard to the Fogarty Wine Group that also owns Lake's Folly in the Hunter Valley, Deep Woods Estate in the Margaret River and Millbrook Winery in the Perth Hills. Lion Nathan has retained the Smithbrook trade name and trademarks, and will continue to market the range of wines under the Smithbrook and Yilgarn labels; the Fogarty Wine Group will sell bulk wine made from grapes grown at the Smithbrook Vineyard to Lion Nathan under a long term bulk wine supply agreement.
