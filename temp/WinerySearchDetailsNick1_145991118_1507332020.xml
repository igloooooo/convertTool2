            Wesley College teacher Sue Taylor and part-time Anglican minister husband Brian have planted 0.8 ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir on their Little Valley property, and built their house there. Ian MacRae is consultant viticulturist, and Rick McIntyre makes the wines. The Mornington Peninsula is a beautiful place, and the Little Valley property itself a prime example of that beauty, providing a return which cannot be measured in dollars and cents.
