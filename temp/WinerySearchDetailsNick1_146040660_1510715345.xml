            The Moltoni family has owned a 2000ha farming property for three generations. Robert Moltoni is the driving force, establishing WindshakeR Ridge in 2003. The vineyard (5ha each of carnelian, semillon, shiraz and verdelho) is 9km north of Gingin, and looks out over the hills to the sea. Moltoni is an accomplished poet, and I cannot help but quote one of his poems: Easterlies whistle through the gums/Crashing over silent ridges/Bathing vines in Namatjira Crimson/WindshakeR, WindshakeR, WindshakeR/The ghost winds whisper down/Off the red plains to the sea. Exports to the US and China.
