            Stephen Hambour and John Sandery began the establishment of the Cape Banks vineyard in 2000, with a planting of 10.7ha of pinot noir. Six ha of chardonnay and 3ha of sauvignon blanc were added in 2002, with 3 moreha of the latter planted in 03 and 06. Riesling (3.3ha) and pinot gris (1ha), both planted 2003, complete what is a substantial vineyard, on the face of it perfectly suited to the very cool Mount Gambier climate. Most of the grapes are sold, with a plan to ultimately make 500 dozen of each of the varieties grown, with a Sparkling Chardonnay and a Pinot Noir the first two releases.
