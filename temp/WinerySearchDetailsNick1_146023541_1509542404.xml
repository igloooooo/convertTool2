            SpringLane is the separately owned wine business of Graeme Rathbone, brother of Doug Rathbone, who is the (corporate) owner of Yering Station. The wines are made at Yering Station from grapes grown on the 14-ha SpringLane vineyard planted to merlot, pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, viognier and cabernet franc. Part of the production is sold to Yering Station, part used for the SpringLane label.
