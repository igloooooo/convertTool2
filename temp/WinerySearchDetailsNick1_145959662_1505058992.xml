            In 1973 the Cirillo family acquired one of the oldest vineyards in Australia, situated in the Light Pass district of the Barossa Valley where the soil is deep silt sand over limestone and clay. This combination of free-draining top soil and water-holding subsoil has sustained the 3ha of grenache, along with 1ha semillon (previously incorrectly called madeira) and 0.5ha of shiraz planted in 1850, the latter complemented by 1ha of shiraz and 0.5ha of mourvedre planted in 1988. Most of the grapes are sold to Torbreck, leaving only a small portion for Cirillo. Exports to the US and Singapore.
