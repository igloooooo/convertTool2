            La Curio has been established by Adam Hooper, who purchases small parcels of grapes from vineyards in McLaren Vale with an average age of 40 years, the oldest 80 years. The wines are made at Redheads Studio, a boutique winery in McLaren Vale that caters for a number of small producers. The manacles depicted on the striking label are those of Harry Houdini, and the brand proposition is very cleverly worked through. Winemaking techniques, too, are avant-garde, and highly successful. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada and Sweden.
