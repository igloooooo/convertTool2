            After five years as chief winemaker for Wandin Hunter Valley, Matthew Burton moved on in 2010 in the wake of the exit of Wandin founders James and Philippa Davern. He is now making four different Hunter Semillons, Shiraz from the Hunter Valley (in the course of changing vineyard sources in 2012) and Murrumbateman. He and wife Renee run the leased cellar door space in the historic Pokolbin school house, next to the old Rosemount/Hungerford Hill building on McDonalds Road. They are also constructing a cellar door at the Gundaroo family property in the Canberra District owned by parents Sharon and Geoff, which has 2.5ha each of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon.
