            The 2.5ha vineyard (cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, chardonnay, semillon, cabernet franc and malbec) was planted in the late 1980s and early 90s by Matthew Chersini and family. Irene Wilson (then working in NZ wineries) and Matthew met at CSU during their wine science degree course; they now have five children, and together run the vineyard, winery, wine garden and cellar door on the outskirts of Toowoomba. The winery produces small quantities of varietal table wines, plus sweet and fortified wines.
