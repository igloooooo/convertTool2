            Sisters Run is owned by noted Barossa Valley vignerons Carl and Peggy Lindner (owners of Langmeil), directly employing the skills of Elena Brooks as winemaker, and, indirectly, the marketing know-how of husband Zar Brooks. The Stiletto and Boot are those of Elena, and the motto The truth is in the vineyard, but the proof is in the glass is, I would guess, the work of Zar Brooks. Exports to all major markets.
