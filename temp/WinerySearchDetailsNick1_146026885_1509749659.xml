            Peter and Paula Hoffman, with sons Paul and Thomas, acquired their property in 1989. It had a long history of grapegrowing, and the prior owner had registered the name Swan Valley Wines back in 83. In 99 the family built a winery to handle the estate-grown chenin blanc, grenache, semillon and cabernet sauvignon. The decision to release three Chenin Blancs from 2010 labelled Sec, Demi Sec and Moelleux respectively, is a precise (completely legitimate) copy of some of the best Loire Valley producers of Chenin Blanc, the most notable being Marc Bredif. Those wines have cellaring capacity of 70 years or more if kept in the cool chalk caves on the banks of the Loire Valley. The Australian climate will not permit that, but it will be interesting to see how the three wines develop.
