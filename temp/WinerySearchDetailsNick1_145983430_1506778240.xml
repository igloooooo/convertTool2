            Jimbour Station was one of the first properties opened in the Darling Downs and the heritage-listed homestead was built in 1876. The property, owned by the Russell family since 1923, has diversified by establishing a vineyard (shiraz, chardonnay, verdelho, cabernet sauvignon, viognier and merlot) and opening a cellar door on the property in a renovated water tower built in 1870. In 2010 the family decided to suspend winemaking and mothball the vineyard; the situation will be reviewed when (and if) market conditions improve. Exports to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and China.
