            The freehold of the former Kamberra winery (built by Hardys prior to becoming part of CWA) was acquired by Elvin Global, a Canberra-based investment and management company. In a relatively short space of time, there were both ownership and management changes leading to the formation of Coffman &amp; Lawson. It has leased the 2200-tonne capacity winery with the primary aim of providing contract winemaking services, but also making wine on its own account from grapes supplied by a co-operative as and when the opportunity arises. Whether these will be cleanskin, buyers-own-brand or under the Coffman &amp; Lawson brand remains to be seen. Winemaker Nick Spencer has an interesting CV that suggests there should be no problem with the quality of the wines at their given price points.
