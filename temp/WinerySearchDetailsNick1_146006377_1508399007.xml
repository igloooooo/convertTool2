            Matt Rechner entered the wine industry in 1988, spending most of the intervening years at Tatachilla in McLaren Vale,starting as laboratory technician and finishing as operations manager. Frustrated by the constraints of large winery practice, he decided to strike out on his own in 2001 via the virtual winery option. His long experience has meant he is able to buy grapes from high quality producers. A restructuring has seen the arrival of Ekhidna (the old spelling of echidna) and the disappearance of Paper Eagle brands. Exports to the US, Canada, NZ, India and China.
