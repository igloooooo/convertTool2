            Arguably the most remote winery in Australia, drawing upon estate vineyards (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, riesling, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc). The quantities are as small as the cellar door prices are modest; this apart, the light but fragrant wines show the cool climate of this ocean-side vineyard. Came from out of the clouds to win the trophy for Best Wine of Show at the WA Show 99 with its Shiraz, but hasnt repeated that success.
