            Earthworks was founded by the Lindner and Bitter families in 2003. Both have been centrally involved in the Barossa wine industry for many years, and were able to persuade the marketing arm of the Hill-Smith Family/Yalumba, Negociants Australia, to handle the domestic distribution of the wine. When the arrangement extended internationally via Negociants International, part of the business was purchased by the Hill-Smith Family, reinforcing their sales, winemaking and marketing efforts with an equity position in Earthworks.
