            St Annes is by far the most active member of the Perricoota region. Richard McLean has established 80ha of estate vineyards, with another 120ha of grower vineyards to draw upon. Shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, grenache and mourvedre account for over 75% of the plantings, but there is a spread of the usual white wines and few red exotics. The wines are all competently made.
