            Lyn and Michael Sykes became the owners of Hainault in 2002, after previous owner Bill Mackey and wife Vicki headed off elsewhere. The close-planted vines are hand-pruned and hand-picked, and the pinot noir is very sensibly used to make a sparkling wine, rather than a table wine.  Exports to China and Hong Kong.
