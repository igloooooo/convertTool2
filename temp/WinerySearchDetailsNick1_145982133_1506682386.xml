            Ironbark Hill Estate is owned by Peter and Leesa Drayton and Michael and Julie Dillon. Peters father, Max Drayton, and brothers John and Greg, run Draytons Family Wines. The estate plantings include shiraz, chardonnay, semillon, cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo, merlot, verdelho and tyrian. Peter is a commercial/industrial builder, so constructing the cellar door was a busmans holiday. The hope is that the striking building and landscape surrounds will bring more wine tourists to the Hermitage Road end of Pokolbin. Exports to China and Hong Kong.
