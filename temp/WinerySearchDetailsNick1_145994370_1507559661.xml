            In 2003 the founders of Matildas Meadow (as it was then known), Don Turnbull and Pamela Meldrum, sold the business to former citizen of the world Steve Hall. It is a thriving business based on the estate plantings of chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, shiraz and merlot. The construction of an onsite winery in 2007 and the building of a substantial restaurant and event facility marked a significant change in the tempo of the business. Exports to Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
