            A little over 20ha of vines were established on the undulating, gum-studded countryside of Charlie and Julie Downers 60-year-old Erinka property, 4km east of Oakbank. In descending order of importance, the varieties planted are sauvignon blanc, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Son Michael, with a Bachelor of Oenology degree from Adelaide University, is assistant winemaker. Exports to the UK and Canada.
