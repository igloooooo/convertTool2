            Andre Deutsch and Jan Ward began the development of their vineyard in 2001 with the planting of pinot noir. The non-irrigated vines have been grown using organic and biodynamic principles, which they believed would best express the terroir of the vineyard, which is on the north-facing slope of the plug of an extinct volcano, with red sandy loam soil. While waiting for the vines to mature, they have purchased grapes grown elsewhere, commencing with a 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot and Cabernet Franc. In a bold move, the wines are not filtered and are free of added preservatives and fining agents. Brad Hooper purchased the vineyard in '10, and are considering various options for the future.
