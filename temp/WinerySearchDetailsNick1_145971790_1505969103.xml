            Owner/winemaker Tim Geddes and wife Amanda, a chef, bring considerable experience to the venture. Tim started in Hawke’s Bay, NZ, with three vintages as a cellar hand, which led to a move to Australia to complete the oenology degree at Adelaide University. Dual vintages in the Barossa and Hunter valleys were woven in between settling down in McLaren Vale, where he has been a contract winemaker for a number of clients since 2002. Tim’s 2007 lease of a 500-tonne winery means even greater contract work, while he slowly builds the Seldom Inn range (made every vintage) and the Geddes label, which is only made in the best years. The long-term aim is to make 3000 cases, relying on small parcels of fruit from a number of selected McLaren Vale subregions. Exports to Canada.
