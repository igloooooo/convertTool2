            Richard and Ingrid Glastonburys cellar door is on land settled in the 1880s by Ingrids ancestor, Johann Christian Henschke. Kabminye is an Aboriginal word meaning morning star, and was given to the hamlet of Krondorf as a result of the anti-German sentiment during the Second World War (since changed back to the original Krondorf). The cellar door and caf opened in 2003; SA Tourism has since used the building as a sustainable tourism case study. The vineyard is planted to durif, shiraz, mourvedre, carignan, cinsaut, princess black muscat and black frontignac. Exports to the UK, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China.
