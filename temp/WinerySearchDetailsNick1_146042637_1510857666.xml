            In 2008 Liz and Simon Gillies acquired a vineyard planted in 1997 to 1.6ha of chardonnay and a little over 1ha of pinot noir. In 09 the grapes were sold to local winemakers, but since 2000 the wines have been made by Sandro Mosele (under the watchful eyes of the Gillies). The wines are available through mail order and specialist retail stores.
