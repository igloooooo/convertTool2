            Planting of the quite substantial Port Stephens Winery vineyard began in 1984, and there are now 4ha of vines in production. The wines are made under contract in the Hunter Valley but sold through the attractive Boutique Wine Centre, which offers over 100 wines from 30 wineries (as far afield as Manjimup in WA).
