            As often happens, the establishment date for a wine producer can mean many things. In this instance it harks back to the planting of the vineyard by the Ayton family, and the establishment of what was thereafter called St Neots. Juliet and Paul Staindl acquired the property in 2002, and, with the guidance of Phillip Jones, have extended the plantings to 2.2ha of pinot noir, 0.6ha of chardonnay and 0.3ha of riesling. The vineyard is run on a low chemical regime, heading towards biodynamic viticulture. Paul says,Its all good fun and lots of learning. I would add its also more than slightly demanding.
