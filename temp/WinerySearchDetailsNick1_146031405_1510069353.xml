            When Tim and Cass McNeil established Tim McNeil Wines, Tim had long since given up his teaching career, graduating with a degree in oenology from Adelaide University in 1999. During his university years he worked at Yalumba, then moved with Cass to the Clare Valley in 2001, spending four years as a winemaker at Jim Barry Wines before moving to Kilikanoon in 05, where he currently works as a winemaker alongside Kevin Mitchell. The McNeils 16ha property at Watervale includes mature, dry-grown riesling, and they intend to plant shiraz, currently purchasing that variety from the Barossa Valley. A cellar door is planned.
