            The Folletts have been farmers at Langhorne Creek since 1880, and grapegrowers since the 1930s. Most of the grape production is sold, but the quality of the Lake Breeze wines has been exemplary, with the red wines particularly appealing. Lake Breeze also owns and makes the False Cape wines from Kangaroo Island. Exports to the US and other major markets.
