            This has been a slow-growing venture owned by Anne and David Ferguson based on vines planted between 1990 and 94. 'The Colins Block Vineyard is planted to shiraz, the Fergs' Block with predominantly cabernet sauvignon and smaller amounts of merlot, cabernet franc and shiraz. The soil is shallow and gravelly loam over clay. No fungicides or pesticides are used, and only minimal drip irrigation.
