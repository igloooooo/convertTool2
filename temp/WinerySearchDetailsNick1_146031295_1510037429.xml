            Three Dark Hoses is the new project for former Coriole winemaker Matt Broomhead. After vintages in southern Italy and the Rhne Valley he returned to McLaren Vale in 2009 and, with his father Alan, runs this small business buying quality grapes thanks to the long experience they both have in the region. The third dark horse is Matt's 87-year-old grandfather, a vintage regular.
