            This is a virtual winery with a twist. Bede Doherty has a background in chemistry, strategic marketing, viticulture and oenology, and has pulled these threads together as a negociant. He has secured the services of highly regarded winemakers from the Barossa Valley, Clare Valley, Yarra Valley, Central Victoria and Margaret River to make wines for his brand, The Doherty Signature Collection. He says the Collection features the winemakers, signatures both on the label and in the bottle, a neat summary. A common price point of $25 for five of the six wines ($30 for the Janice McDonald Cabernet Merlot) has the virtue of simplicity. Exports to China.
