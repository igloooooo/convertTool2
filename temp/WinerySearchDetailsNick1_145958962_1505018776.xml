            Chimes Estate founders Philip and Margaret Thompson live in Claremont, Perth, commuting to the vineyard, orchard and olive grove on weekends and holidays. The 30ha property, situated 13km northeast of the Margaret River township, is located in a valley surrounded by state forest and cattle farms. From 2001 to 06 they established 3ha of cabernet sauvignon, 1.5ha each of sauvignon blanc and semillon and 1ha of merlot (the two white varieties planted in 06, the reds in 01 and 02). Most of the grapes are sold, but the intention is to increase production with a Merlot as well as Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon-based wines at mouthwatering prices.
