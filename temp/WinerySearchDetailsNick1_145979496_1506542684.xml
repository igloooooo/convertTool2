            Peter and Anthea Hoffmann began the rehabilitation of their vineyard, replanting poor varieties with premium grapes (cabernet sauvignon and shiraz) at their property in 1978, and Peter has worked at various wineries in McLaren Vale since 79. Both he and Anthea have undertaken courses at the Regency TAFE Institute in Adelaide, and (in Peters words), in 1996 we decided that we knew a little about winemaking and opened a small cellar door. Prior to that time the grapes from the rejuvenated vineyard had been sold to other winemakers. Exports to the UK, the US and Germany.
