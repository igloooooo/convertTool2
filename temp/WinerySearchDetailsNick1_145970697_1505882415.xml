            Francois (Franky) Jacquard graduated from Dijon University in 1983. He worked that vintage as a cellar hand at Domaine Dujac, and came to Australia for Bannockburn in 1985. Between then and 1992 he worked in both the northern and southern hemispheres, before moving back to Australia to become chief winemaker at Chittering Estate in the Perth Hills in 1992, a position he held until 97 when he established his own brand. He has since kept a consistently low profile.
