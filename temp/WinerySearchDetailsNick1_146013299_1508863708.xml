            Planting of the Redesdale Estate vines began in 1982 on the northeast slopes of a 25ha grazing property, fronting the Campaspe River on one side. The rocky quartz and granite soil meant the vines had to struggle, and when Peter Williams and wife Suzanne Arnall-Williams purchased the property in 1988 the vineyard was in a state of disrepair. They have rejuvenated the vineyard, planted an olive grove, and, more recently, erected a two-storey house surrounded by a garden, which is part of the Victorian Open Garden Scheme (and cross-linked to a villa in Tuscany).
