            Massoni is a substantial business owned by the Pellegrino and Ursini families, and is a venture with two completely distinct arms. In terms of vineyard and land size, by far the largest is the GlenKara vineyard in the Pyrenees (269ha). It endured years of drought, which finally broke in 2010, giving the venture much to look forward to. It also has 8.5ha on the Mornington Peninsula where Massoni started, and where it gained its reputation.
