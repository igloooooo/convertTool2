            Bernard (Bernie) Worthington, a Perth-based property specialist, developed a serious interest in wine and spent four years looking for a site which met all his criteria: ample water, easy access to a major city and supporting tourist attractions. During that time he also completed a wine-growing course at CSU. His interests coalesced when he found Drakesbrook, a 216ha property taking its name from the Drakesbrook River which flows through it. An hours drive from Perth, it has views out to the ocean and is adjacent to the Lake Navarino tourist resort. He has subdivided the property, retaining 121 ha. The vineyard is planted to semillon, chardonnay, shiraz, merlot, petit verdot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon. A cellar door is planned.
