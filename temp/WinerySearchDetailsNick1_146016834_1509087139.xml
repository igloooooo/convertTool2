            The 408ha Roslyn Estate is part of a much larger property dating back to 1821, which has had only three owners in the intervening time. In 2000, when the property was divided, the homestead and surrounding land was purchased by the Allen family. In 2001 the planting of vines began on various parts of the property, selected by soil type and a north-facing aspect; in all, there are 27 different blocks at different altitudes, the lions share given to just under 18ha of pinot noir and a little over 11ha of chardonnay. Other varieties planted are sauvignon blanc, riesling, merlot, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and petit verdot. The 2006 Unwooded Chardonnay won silver medals in 07 and 08 at the Tasmanian Wines Show, the 07 Sauvignon Blanc won a gold medal in 08. Exports to the Maldives.
