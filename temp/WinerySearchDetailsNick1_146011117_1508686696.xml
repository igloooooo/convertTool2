            This is a new and separate venture for Rhys and Garth Eather (of Meerea Park), taking as its raison dtre wines that clearly show their postcode by exhibiting true regional character. The initial releases were two Shirazs from the Hunter Valley (2320) with a Cabernet Sauvignon from Hilltops (2587), and with several white wines in the future mix. After a slow and opaque start there is now clarity to the focus. Exports to China.
