            David and Catherine Ritchie (of Delatite fame) set up Booroolite Wines in 2004 to salvage locally grown, high-quality grapes which could not find an owner. They have started with an Unoaked Chardonnay and a Cabernet Merlot blend, and the product range will vary according to grape supply and pricing. The aim is to provide wines from small vineyards which are competitive price-wise with wines from the big companies.
