            Owner and viticulturist Chris Cormack accumulated an oenological degree and experience in every facet of the wine industry here and overseas before beginning the establishment of the close-planted, non-irrigated, low-yielding Pegeric Vineyard at an altitude of 640m on red volcanic basalt soil. As a separate exercise, he has also made several vintages of a cross-regional blend of Cabernet Shiraz named Tumbetin. He has recently planted a small block of riesling. Exports to China.
