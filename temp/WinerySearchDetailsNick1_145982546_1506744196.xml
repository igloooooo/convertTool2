            Justin and Pip Jarrett have established a substantial vineyard (140ha), planted to chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, sauvignon blanc, merlot, pinot noir, riesling, marsanne, cabernet franc and verdelho. They also provide management and development services to growers of another 120ha in the region. Most of the grapes are sold, with a limited amount vinified for local distribution and by mail order.
