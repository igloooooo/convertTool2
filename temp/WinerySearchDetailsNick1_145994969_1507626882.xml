            The ever-convivial, bigger-than-life, Bob McLean has covered a lot of wine turf over the past 40 years. The farm shed on the home property produces 1000 dozen of red wine; the remainder of the production is contract-made by some very savvy winemakers. There are now three brands: barr-Eden from the dry-grown estate vineyard and sold only ex cellar for private buyers and some trade; McLeans Farmgate, made in lots of 250300 dozen each when special parcels of grapes become available from a few old chums; and McLeans Farm, 100% Barossa fruit and made through the Dorrien Estate facility. These wines are sold through Cellarmasters, but with some restaurant listings. The barr-Eden Vineyard, at an altitude of around 500m, is one of the highest in the Eden Valley, and the annual blend of some or all of its grenache, shiraz and mataro is strictly dependent on the quality and character of the components from year to year. Exports to the UK.
