            The Forbes family has been involved in cattle farming for over 120 years, and in partnership with Maryborough lawyer Kelvin Noonan, has established a small vineyard equally divided between shiraz and semillon. The block in question had been of no use for grazing, and with the assistance of many friends, the area was deep-ripped, large rocks removed, posts embedded, trellis completed and drip irrigation from dams on the property installed. The partners say they have a predisposition to wine tasting, so one wonders just how much of the wine will remain available for sale.
