            The Carija family has owned and operated vineyards in the Swan Valley since 1957, culminating in the establishment of Carilley Estate in 85 by doctors Laura and Isavel Carija. The 4.2ha vineyard is planted to chardonnay, chenin blanc, viognier, shiraz, malbec, merlot and grenache. Most of the grapes are sold, with a small proportion made under the Carilley Estate label.
