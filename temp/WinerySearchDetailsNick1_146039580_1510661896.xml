            Willow Creek Vineyard is a significant presence in the Mornington Peninsula, with the mature vineyard planted to pinot noir, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc and pinot gris. The grape intake is supplemented by purchasing small, quality parcels from local growers. The Willow Creek wines rank with the best from the Peninsula, the arrival of Geraldine McFaul as winemaker promising a continuation in the quality of the wines.
