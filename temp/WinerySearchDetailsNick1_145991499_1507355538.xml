            Medical practitioner Brian Gilbert began collecting wine when he was 19, flirting with the idea of becoming a winemaker before being headed firmly in the direction of medicine by his parents. Thirty or so years later he purchased a blackberry- and gorse-infested 12ha property in the Adelaide Hills, eventually obtaining permission to establish a vineyard. Chardonnay (2ha) was planted in 2004, and 1ha of pinot noir in 07, both on steep slopes.
