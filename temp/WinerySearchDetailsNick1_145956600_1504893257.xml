            Cedar Creek Estate takes its name from the creek which flows through the property at an altitude of 550m on Mt Tamborine. The vineyard is planted to chambourcin and verdelho, and is supplemented by grapes grown in South Burnett. The focus will always be on general tourism, with a host of facilities for visitors, including a restaurant. It has also opened The Queensland Wine Centre, stocking wines from a substantial number of local producers.
