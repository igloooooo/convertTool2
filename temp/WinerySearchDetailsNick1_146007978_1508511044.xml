            Penmara was formed with the banner Five Families: One Vision, pooling most of their grapes, with a central processing facility, and marketing focused exclusively on exports. The sites are Lilyvale Vineyards in New England; Tangaratta Vineyards at Tamworth; Birnam Wood and Martindale Vineyards in the Hunter Valley; and Highland Heritage at Orange. In all, these vineyards give Penmara access to 120ha of shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, semillon, verdelho and merlot, mainly from the Hunter Valley and Orange. Exports to South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and China.
