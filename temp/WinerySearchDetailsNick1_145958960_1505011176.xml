            Cheviot Bridge made headlines when it purchased the Tyrrells Long Flat range of wines in 2003, but the nature of the business has changed substantially since then. In late 2010 Cheviot Bridge acquired the InWine Group and its principal wineries, Arrowfield Estate and Red Hill Estate. While the production of these two wineries is less than that of Cheviot Bridge, the brands thus acquired are well known, and add depth to the Cheviot Bridge portfolio. In its own right, Cheviot Bridge produces 350 000 dozen from the Clare, Barossa and Yarra valleys, utilising custom-make facilities in various places. The brands also include Cheviot Bridge Yea Valley, Long Flat, Long Flat Destinations, La Vie and Kissing Bridge.  Exports to all major markets
