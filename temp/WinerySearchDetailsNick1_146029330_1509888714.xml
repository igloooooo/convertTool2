            In 2001, the Batchelor family (headed by former AMP chief executive Paul Batchelor) acquired Terrace Vale. In late 2004 Terrace Vale (and its various second labels and brands) was merged with Cheviot Bridge/The Long Flat Wine Co, of which Paul Batchelor is now non- executive chairman. Marketing in Australia and overseas is undertaken by Cheviot Bridge.
