            Phil and Sandy Goldring spent 10 years operating farm chalets in the Pemberton area before selling the business and retiring to become grapegrowers, with the intention of selling the grapes. However, they found old habits hard to kick, so opened a cellar door and restaurant. A renovated 1901 Kalgoorlie tram (the streetcar named Desire) has been installed to provide more seating for the award-winning restaurant.
