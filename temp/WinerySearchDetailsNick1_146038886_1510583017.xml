            Terry and Margaret Walsh are the fourth generation to have carried on farming on the property settled by their ancestor John Walsh in 1861. The location of the cellar door, a renovated 1937 cottage in the town of Nanango, gave rise to the name, as it is next to a railway line which operated between 1911 and 64. The wines are made from 2ha of cabernet sauvignon, 1ha of recently grafted verdelho and a small amount of viognier, and also from purchased grapes.
