            The shepherds hut that appears on the wine label was one of four stone huts used in the 1850s to house shepherds tending large flocks of sheep. When WA pathologist Dr Michael Wishart (and family) purchased the property in 1996, the hut was in a state of extreme disrepair. It has since been restored, still featuring the honey-coloured Mt Barker stone. Riesling, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon have been established. The business is now owned by son Philip and wife Cathy, who also run a large farm of mainly cattle. Most of the grapes are sold to other makers in the region.
