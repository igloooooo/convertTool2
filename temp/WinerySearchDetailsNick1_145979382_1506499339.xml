            The origins of Highlander Wines date back to 1977 when Don Cumming and his family established Mountilford Wines at Ilford in one of the highest sites in Mudgee. The new business at Orange is run by son David Cumming and Jane Gordon, and produces Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Sangiovese and Chardonnay Viognier.
