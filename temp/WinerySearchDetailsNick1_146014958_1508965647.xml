            Rivendell was established in 1987 by a local family and became recognised for its gardens, restaurant and wines. The property was purchased by private investors in 2004, who have renovated the restaurant (with locally renowned chef Peter Clatworthy) and cellar door. The new owners have employed James Pennington to oversee the improvements to the winery and its production, based in part upon estate plantings of cabernet sauvignon, semillon and sauvignon blanc. Exports to Singapore.
