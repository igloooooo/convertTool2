            Peerick is the venture of Chris Jessup and wife Meryl. They have mildly trimmed their Josephs coat vineyard by increasing the plantings to 5.6ha and eliminating the malbec and semillon, but still grow cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, cabernet franc, merlot, sauvignon blanc and viognier. Quality has improved as the vines have reached maturity. Exports to NZ.
