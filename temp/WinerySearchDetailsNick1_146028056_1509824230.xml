            Tantemaggie was established by the Pottinger family with the help of a bequest from a deceased aunt named Maggie. It is part of a mixed farming operation, and by far the greatest part of the vineyard is under long-term contract to Houghton. The bulk of the plantings are cabernet sauvignon, verdelho, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, the former producing the light-bodied style favoured by the Pottingers.
