            Situated on the picturesque Mount View Road, Millfield made its market debut in 2000. The neatly labelled and packaged wines have won gold medals and trophies right from the first vintage in 1998, and praise from wine writers and critics in Australia and the UK. The wines are sold through the cellar door and by mailing list, and through a limited number of fine wine retail and top-quality restaurants. Exports to the UK.
