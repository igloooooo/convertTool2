            Richard and Rachel Trounson, with help from father Barry Trounson, have established 20ha of vineyards at Benerin Estate since 1995. Most of the grapes are sold, but small quantities of wine are made for the Wells Parish label. The vineyards are at the eastern extremity of the Mudgee region, near Rylstone, and both the soils and climate are distinctly different from those of the traditional Mudgee area.
