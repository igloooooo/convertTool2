            Oddfellows is the name taken by a group of five individuals who decided to put their expertise, energy and investments into making premium wine. Langhorne Creek vignerons David and Cathy Knight were two of the original members, and in 2007 took over ownership and running of the venture. David worked with Greg Follett from Lake Breeze to produce the wines, gradually taking over more responsibility, and is now both winemaker and viticulturist for the estates vineyard. This vineyard also produces the Winners Tank label (in conjunction with Reid Bosward of Kaesler Wines in the Barossa); the first two vintages were made for export only (Canada), with limited domestic distribution of the 06 vintage. Since then, production has trebled. Exports to the UK, Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China.
