            The word historic is as much overused as the word passionate, but this is a historic property with a quite remarkable story. The twice-married Honorah Mullins, first to a Mr Doyle and later to a Mr Mullins, moved with her husband from County Cork, Ireland, to Australia in 1875. In 1876 they established the family dairy farm, now Glengariff Estate. At the age of 90, Honorah was still milking a herd of 40 cows, and when 111 she continued to take her morning walk with one of her sons, Dennis Doyle. When she died on 1 May 1926, 1 day before her 115th birthday, she had lived through the reign of six English monarchs, from George III to George V. Tracey Wrightson, the great-great-granddaughter of Honorah, together with husband Andrew and children, now own and run the 100ha Glengariff Estate. It operates as a tourist attraction, with a restaurant and wedding function venue and as a grapegrower and wine producer.
