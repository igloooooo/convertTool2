            Irish-born George and Sue Mullins came to Australia over 30 years ago, but it was not until 1999 that they purchased the property and opened a B&amp;B business. The potential for wine became obvious, and 550 chambourcin vines were planted in 2000 at the front of the 5ha property, giving rise to the first vintage in 03. The cellar door also acts as a satellite cellar door for Robinsons Family Vineyards.
