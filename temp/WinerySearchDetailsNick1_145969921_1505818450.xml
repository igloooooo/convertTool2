            Electrical engineer Jessica Worrall and chemical engineer Rob Glass worked in the oil and gas industry in Australia and The Netherlands for 20 years before making a staged move into grapegrowing and the establishment of Firetail. Their first move was the planting of a small vineyard of merlot in Geographe, which produced its first wine in 2003; a more important move was the acquisition of a somewhat neglected vineyard (and rammed-earth house) in Margaret River. Here the Geographe merlot is supplemented by semillon, sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon, the Margaret River plantings dating back to 2004. Jessica is in the final stages of completing her Masters of Viticulture at Wine Technology at the University of Melbourne whilst managing the vineyard and the wine production, and Rob balances the demands of the wine sales and marketing with consulting for the liquid natural gas business. It comes as no surprise to find that the wines are contract-made. Exports to Hong Kong, Japan and China.
