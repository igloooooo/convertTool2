            Trevor Knaggs, with the assistance of his father Collin, began the establishment of King River Estate in 1990, making the first wines in 96. The initial plantings were 3.3ha each of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, followed by 8ha of merlot and 3ha of shiraz. More recent plantings have extended the varietal range to include verdelho, viognier, barbera and sangiovese. Biodynamic practices have been used in the vineyard since 2008. Exports to China and Singapore.
