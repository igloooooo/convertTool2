            John and Donna Bruschi are second-generation grapegrowers who assumed full ownership of the Potters Clay Vineyard in 1994 with the aim of establishing their own winery and label. In 1999 they completed stage one of a two-stage boutique winery. Stage one is a 100-tonne capacity winery production facility; stage two (at some future date) will be cellar door, restaurant and garden/picnic area. Exports to Singapore and China.
