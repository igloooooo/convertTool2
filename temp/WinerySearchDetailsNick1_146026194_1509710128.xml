            Stuart Range has had a turbulent history since 1997, when a newly-equipped winery was established in part of a large, old butter factory in Kingaroy. Since then there has been a change of ownership, but business as usual (3 growers with 50 ha supply the winery) continues. The prior history of the business is reflected in cheese-making and olive oil-processing on site.
