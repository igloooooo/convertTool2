            Josh and Karen Liberman have energetically expanded the range of Darling Parks wines while maintaining a high quality standard. The Art of Wine club offers back vintages, as well as previews of upcoming releases. Wine labels feature artworks from the owners collections; artists include Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, John Perceval and Charles Blackman. The most important source of grapes for the venture is Hugh Robinson, who produces some of the best grapes available for sale on the Mornington Peninsula. The arrangement with Darling Park is a permanent one, with purchase by area, rather than by tonnes of grapes produced.
