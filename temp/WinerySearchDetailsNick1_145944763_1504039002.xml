            The establishment of the 32-ha Baarrooka Vineyard began in 1996, on a north-facing slope at an elevation of 550 m. Plantings consist of riesling, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot, zinfandel and small blocks of petit verdot, cabernet franc and malbec. The majority of the grapes are sold under contract into the Yarra Valley, but a small quantity is released under the Baarrooka label, the quantities and varieties varying according to the vintage.
