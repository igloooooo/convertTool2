            This is a 50/50 joint venture between American John Larchet and Adelaide Winemakers (see separate entry). Larchet has long had a leading role as a specialist importer of Australian wines into the US, and guarantees the business whatever sales it needs there. Its shiraz, grenache and mourvedre come from old,single-site blocks in McLaren Vale. Wines were received after the 2013 edition went to print. Exports to the US, Canada, EU, South Korea, Hong Kong and China.
