            Allan Dyson, who described himself (a few years ago) as a young man of 50-odd years, has recently added to his 1.5ha of viognier with 2.5ha of cabernet sauvignon, 2ha of chardonnay and 0.5ha of sangiovese, and has absolutely no thoughts of slowing down or retiring. All wines are estate grown, made and bottled. Exports to Taiwan and Thailand.
