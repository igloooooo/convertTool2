            The 5ha vineyard, planted to shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, ruby cabernet, muscat and verdelho, is near Mt Perry, 1 hours drive west of Bundaberg at the extreme northern end of the Burnett Valley, extending the viticultural map of Qld yet further. There is a 100-tonne winery, and the tasting room is in a restored slab hut dating from the turn of the 20th century. There are numerous tourist attractions around Mt Perry, not the least being the Boolboonda Tunnel, the largest self-supporting tunnel in the southern hemisphere, hand-hewn, and home to a colony of fairy bats.
