            A stand-alone business owned by Andrew and Lisa Margan, with a fascinating portfolio of wines based on exclusive or fairly new winegrowing regions on the western side of the Great Dividing Range. The selection of the vineyard sites (via contract growers) involves a careful correlation of latitude, altitude, soil type and variety  the French catch it all in the single word terroir. The packaging of the wines, incidentally, is brilliant. Exports to the UK.
