            Steven and Sharlene Dadd had been growing grapes for over a decade before realising a long-held dream to launch their own wines under the Optimiste label. The name is inspired by their sons struggle with deafness and a quote by Helen Keller: Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence. The first vines planted were cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and merlot, with more recent plantings of viognier, semillon, tempranillo and pinot gris (chardonnay is purchased). A cellar door is planned. Exports to Singapore.
