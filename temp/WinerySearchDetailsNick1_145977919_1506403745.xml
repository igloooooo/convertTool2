            The origins of Heathvale go back to 1865, when William Heath purchased the property, building the homestead and establishing the vineyard. The wine was initially made in the cellar of the house, which still stands on the property (now occupied by owners Trevor and Faye March). The vineyards were re-established in 1987, and consist of shiraz (4.5ha), cabernet sauvignon, riesling and chardonnay (2ha each), and sagrantino (0.5ha). The onsite winery was completed in 2008. Exports to China.
