            Established in 1982, Ladbroke Grove is a relatively old Coonawarra brand. However, while the vineyards remained, winemaking and marketing lapsed until the business was purchased by John Cox and Marie Valenzuela, who have quietly gone about the re-establishment and rejuvenation of the label and were rewarded by a string of wine show results. It has extensive grape sources, including the Killian vineyard (10ha), planted in 1990 to cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay. It also leases a little over 1ha of dry-grown shiraz planted in 1965 in the centre of the Coonawarra township. In 2002 it planted another 11ha at the northern end of Coonawarra to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, viognier, riesling and merlot.
