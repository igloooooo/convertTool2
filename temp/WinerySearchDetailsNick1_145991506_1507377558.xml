            Sandra (exkindergarten teacher turned cheesemaker) and Guido Vazzoler (exBrown Brothers) acquired the long-established Longleat Estate vineyard in 2003 (renaming it Murchison Wines), after living on the property (as tenants) for some years. The mature vineyard comprises 3.2ha of shiraz, 2.3ha of cabernet sauvignon, 0.8ha each of semillon, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, and 0.2ha petit verdot. Exports to Hong Kong and China.
