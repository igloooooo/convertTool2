            Mulyan is a 1350ha grazing property purchased by the Fagan family in 1886 from Dr William Redfern, a leading 19th-century figure in Australian history. The current-generation owners, Peter and Jenni Fagan, began planting in 1994, and intend the vineyard area to be 100ha in all. Presently there are 28.5ha of shiraz, 14.5ha of chardonnay, and 4ha each of merlot and viognier. The label features a statue of the Roman god Mercury, which has stood in the homestead garden since being brought back from Italy in 1912 by Peters grandmother. Exports to the UK and China.
