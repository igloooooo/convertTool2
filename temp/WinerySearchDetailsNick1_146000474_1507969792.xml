            Mount Stapylton Vineyard is planted on the historic Goonwinnow Homestead farming property at Laharum on the northwest side of the Grampians in front of Mt Stapylton. In 2010 founders Howard and Samantha Staehr sold the homestead property, but leased back the vineyard. The wine is listed with several iconic restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne.
