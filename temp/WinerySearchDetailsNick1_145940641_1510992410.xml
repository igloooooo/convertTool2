            Yet another winery with a numeric name giving book indexers and sommeliers nightmares, but better than the unpronounceable GPS co-ordinates used by another winery. Owners and partners Barbara Smith and Geoff Schippers purchased the 4ha former Rothbury Ridge vineyard in 2006. At that stage it had a quixotic planting of 1.6ha of durif and 1.2ha of chambourcin dating back to the early 1990s, when both varieties were uncommon, and the new owners sensibly decided to plant an additional 0.6ha each of semillon and barbera. It is a weekend retreat for Barbara and Geoff, who have busy lives in Sydney.
