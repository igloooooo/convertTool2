            Dr John Stocker and wife Joanne must be among the most highly qualified boutique vineyard and winery operators in Australia. John is the former chief executive of CSIRO and was chairman of the Grape and Wine Research &amp; Development Corporation for seven years, while daughter Nina has completed the Roseworthy postgraduate oenology course. Moreover, they established their first vineyard (while living in Switzerland) on the French/Swiss border in the village of Flueh. On returning to Australia in 1987 they found a property on the inside of the Great Dividing Range with north-facing slopes and shallow, weathered ironstone soils. Here they have established 2.5ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, and 0.5ha each of merlot and gamay, selling the majority of grapes from the 20-year-old vines,but making small quantities of Cabernet Merlot, Merlot and Gamay. The brave goose in question was the sole survivor of a flock put into the vineyard to repel cockatoos and foxes.
