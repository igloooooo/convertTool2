            Pettavel is a major landmark in the Geelong region. Mike and wife Sandi Fitzpatrick sold their large Murray Darling winery and vineyards and moved to Geelong, and in 1990 began developing vineyards at Sutherlands Creek. They have been joined by daughter Robyn (who manages the overseas business) and son Reece (who co-ordinates the viticultural resources). A striking winery/restaurant complex was opened in 2002. Exports to the UK, the US, Russia, China and Japan.
