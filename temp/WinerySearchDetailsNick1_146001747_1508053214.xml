            Samuel and Anna Andriske were part of a wave of Germans who left their homeland in the 1840s to escape poverty, wars and religious differences. The majority settled in the Barossa Valley, but one group was brought to Geelong by its then mayor. Grapegrowing was part of a mixed farming business for the Andriskes, but in the wake of phylloxera the third generation (Charles Andriske) moved to Mildura. His sons established Mulcra Estate in 1933, selling grapes to Mildura and also producing table grapes. Finally, the fifth generation, Marlene Andriske and son Mark, have made the move from grapegrowing to winemaking, with 3ha of chardonnay, supplemented by grapes purchased from a local grower.
