            The Straws Lane vineyard was planted in 1987, but the Straws Lane label arrived on the scene with the highly successful '95 vintage. Adverse weather in 1996 and ??97 meant that little or no wine was made in those years, but the pace picked up again with later vintages. Stuart Anderson guides the making of the Pinot Noir, Hanging Rock Winery handles the Gewurztraminer and the sparkling wine base. It??s good to have co-operative neighbours.
