            In 1990 planting of the present total of 2ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, sangiovese, merlot and nebbiolo began. Their sangiovese was one of the first plantings of the variety in the Bendigo region. The micro-production is sold through the cellar door while stocks last, which typically is not for very long. Now owned by Huw Williams and family.
