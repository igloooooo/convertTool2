            The property name comes from the fact that the original subdivision created a tiny 12-acre block in the midst of 1000-acre properties, giving rise to the local nickname of Bastard Block, less suited for a winery brand. When purchased in 1987, it was completely overgrown, and Peter and Jana Prygodicz have done all the work themselves, doing it the tough way without any mains power, relying on a generator and solar panels. This is their house, winery and cellar door block; the grapes for the wines come from local grapegrowers.
