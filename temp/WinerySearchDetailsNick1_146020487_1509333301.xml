            Robert and Deborah Sharp established Sevenoaks Wines in 1997, with the intention of selling the grapes to other winemakers. With only 2ha of shiraz, 1.5ha of sangiovese and 0.5ha of petit verdot, it was inevitable that the wine from their grapes would be blended with many others, so in 2000 the Sharps changed course, retaining John Hordern as winemaker. The vineyard is part of a 68ha property which abuts the Wollemi National Park at the bottom of the slope that rises to be Mt Woodlands. Exports to Singapore, Malaysia and China.
