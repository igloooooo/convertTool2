            Rod Schmidt and Jacquie Bliss have established their 3.5-ha vineyard (gewurztraminer, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon) at the extreme northern end of the Macedon Ranges region, abutting the southern perimeter of the Heathcote region. For better or worse, they have to use the Macedon Ranges GI, but the wines achieve a greater degree of ripeness than those from the coolest parts of the Macedon Ranges. The wines have been well made, first by Mark Nicol (now gone to Oregon) and, since 2007, at Cobaw Ridge.
