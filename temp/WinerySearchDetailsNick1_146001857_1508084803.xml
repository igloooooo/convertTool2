            The Murrin Bridge Vineyard arose out of a program between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) undertaken in 1999 by five members of the Murrin Bridge Aboriginal community, who had received training for a diploma in viticulture from the TAFE college at Griffith. Plantings began with 2 ha of shiraz in 1999, followed by a further 8 ha in 2000, and another extension in '02 with shiraz, semillon and chardonnay. Very attractive wine bottle stands are handmade from local hardwoods gathered from the paddocks and banks of the Lachlan River.
