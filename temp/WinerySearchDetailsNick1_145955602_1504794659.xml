            Cape Thomas vineyards are owned and operated by Maureen, Peter and Tom Andrews, the family having been farming in the district for over 50 years. Peter was a student at Roseworthy Agricultural College in the early 1960s, but it was not until 95 that he fulfilled his long-held ambition to diversify into viticulture. Until 2004 all of the grapes were sold to Cellarmasters and Norfolk Rise, but since then wines have been made under the Cape Thomas label, the first release coming in 06. The wines are sold at the Mount Benson Wine &amp; Tourism Centre (along with Guichen Bay Vineyards wines), which is owned and operated by a community trust offering a range of facilities for visitors and community projects.
