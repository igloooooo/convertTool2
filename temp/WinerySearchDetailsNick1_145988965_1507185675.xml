            Richard and Penny Clementson began the planting of their vineyard in 1997 with the intention of selling all but a small portion of the grapes, and have not deviated from that game plan. They have a little less than 1 ha each of sauvignon blanc, verdelho, pinot gris and shiraz, and slightly over 0.5 ha of chardonnay. The varietal mix has changed a little since 1994 with grafting of some of the shiraz to sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, which have proved well suited to the vineyard. The Laurellyn range includes Sauvignon Blanc Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris and Shiraz.
