            This is the family-owned business of Rick Lacey and wife Maira Vitols. They purchased the property, situated on a small peninsula that is part of Phillip Island, in 2001, and planted the first 2ha of vines in 02. Subsequent plantings have increased the area to 4.7ha of pinot noir, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, sauvignon blanc and viognier. Rick Lacey had a horticultural background, and his professional life prior to Purple Hen was as an agricultural economist; he is completing degrees in wine science and viticulture at CSU.
