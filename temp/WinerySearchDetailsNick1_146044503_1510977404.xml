            Zig Zag Roads dry-grown vines produce relatively low yields, and until 1996 the grapes were sold to Hanging Rock Winery. In 1996 the decision was taken to manage the property on a full-time basis, and to make the wine onsite. In 2002 Eric and Anne Bellchambers became the third owners of this vineyard, planted by Roger Aldridge in 1972. The Bellchambers have extended the plantings with riesling and merlot, supplementing the older plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir.
