            Andrew and Yvonne Bruce began the planting of their riesling, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon in 1998. Andrew is a barrister, and Yvonne a former operating theatre nurse, and say, We went into the enterprise as a retirement project and with complete ignorance, something that is a requirement in this industry, because if you know anything about it you wont even think of it. That is somewhat disingenuous, because they are determined to grow high quality grapes to turn into high quality wine. Moreover, Yvonnes role as managing partner stems from her early life on her parents farm in the Murray Mallee, and the discipline subsequently learnt in hospital theatres.
