            Marcus and Roslyn Schulz are the fifth generation of one of the best known wine families (or, rather, extended families) in the Barossa Valley. Four generations of grapegrowing and winemaking precede them, but they went down a new path by initiating biological farming in 2002. They have moved from irrigation and extensive spraying to the situation where the vines are now virtually dry-grown, producing generous yields of high quality grapes, using natural nitrogen created by the active soil biology, and minimal chemical input. The vineyard is planted to 12 varieties, shiraz, mourvedre, grenache and cabernet sauvignon leading the band. They are also actively involved in a local co-operative campaign to protect blocks of native vegetation to encourage biodiversity. As might be imagined, the lions share of the grapes is sold to other producers (some finding its way to Torbreck).
