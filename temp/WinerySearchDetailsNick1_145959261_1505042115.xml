            Jennifer Duncan explains the background to Chudacud in fine style. This was my husbands dream and my nightmare!!!! Anyone with the slightest notion that wandering through the vineyard hand-in-hand is romantic  think again. Its damn hard work, but I must admit when the cork comes out of the bottle it makes it all worthwhile. To that I can only add Amen. Their 1ha of shiraz planted in 2001 (after moving from the city) makes them the smallest winery in the Blackwood Valley. However, given the absence of food in the Blackwood wine country, the Duncans have built a commercial kitchen consisting of six barbecues where patrons can choose from rump steak, lamb, fish or chicken and cook their own, accompanied by gourmet salad. Its an old idea, but one that works very well.
