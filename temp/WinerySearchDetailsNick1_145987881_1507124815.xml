            Lakeview Estate is the venture of John and Jillian Doyle, who began the development of the vineyard at a site 650m above sea level, 10km south of Yass. It overlooks the Brindabella Ranges and the Murrumbidgee arm of the Burrinjuck Dam, fully justifying the overused spectacular views tag. The elevation and slope of the vineyard provides perfect air drainage to the Murrumbidgee River, resulting in a frost-free environment, often a problem in this part of the world. The Doyles have planted merlot, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and semillon, and elect to sell part of the grape production.
