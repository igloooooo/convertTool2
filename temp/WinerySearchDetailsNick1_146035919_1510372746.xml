            The Mader family has a long connection with the Barossa Valley. Ian Mader is a fifth-generation descendant of Gottfried and Maria Mader, who immigrated to the Barossa Valley in the 1840s, and his wife, Suzanne, is the daughter of a former long-serving vineyard manager for Penfolds. In 1969 Ian and Suzanne established their Sandy Ridge Vineyard, and more recently the Turrung Vineyard (together a total of 30ha), a few mins from Tanunda. Having been grapegrowers for 30 years, in 1999 they established Vinecrest, using a small portion of the production from their vineyards. Vinecrest was purchased by the Indian drinks conglomerate Indage Vintners in March 2008. Exports to the US, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore.
