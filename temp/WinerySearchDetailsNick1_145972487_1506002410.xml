            Kate and Stuart Gibson say they spent 15 years searching for the perfect site to grow classic pinot noir. They ultimately settled on a north-facing slope of the Red Hill area of the Mornington Peninsula. It is 110m above sea level, and is on a moderate (15) incline, picking up maximum sun interception, which allows them to pick a little earlier than vineyards further up the Red Hill hillsides. The 2.5ha of pinot noir is planted in three equal blocks of MV6, 114 and 115 clones, two-thirds planted on vigour-reducing rootstocks, thus limiting the yield to 2 tonnes to the acre.
