            Rosevears Estate has had a turbulent track record since being established in 1999. It has now passed into the ownership of Tamar Ridge, but the brand will remain (as will Notley Gorge), and the beautifully situated winery and cellar door will showcase not only the Rosevears and Notley Gorge wines, but also the Pirie Tasmania portfolio.
