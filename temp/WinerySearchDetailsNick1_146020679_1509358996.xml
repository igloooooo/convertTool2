            Shawwood Estate has been established a mere 2.5km from Mudgee, on a slight rise on the northern side overlooking the township. A group of investors, including Charles Tym, Alison Bishop and Craig Bishop, have planted 3.3ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, and 1.7ha each of chardonnay and verdelho.
