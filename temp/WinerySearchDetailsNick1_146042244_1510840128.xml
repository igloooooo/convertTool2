            Former professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Melbourne Bill Sawyer, and wife Diana, planted 1.6ha of pinot noir and 0.4ha of pinot gris between 1998 and 99. The vineyard overlooks Swan Bay and the southwesterly weather off Bass Strait provides a cool climate and ensures the slow ripening of fruit. The intention was to sell the grapes to other wineries, but in 2004 they could not resist the temptation to start making Pinot Noir on the estate. An unusual application of the pinot noir is the making of a fortified wine that has won People's Choice awards at the Federation Square Regional Tasting two years in succession.
