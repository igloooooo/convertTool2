            The Warraroong vineyard was planted in 1978, the name an Aboriginal word for hillside, reflecting the southwesterly aspect of the property, which looks back towards the Brokenback Range and Watagan Mountains. In 2007 Katrina and Russell Leslie moved to the Hunter Valley, buying existing wineries and/or brands, with the early stages under the Swish Wine umbrella. Tin Solider came and went, and after protracted discussions, Wandin Estate also became part of the group. Warraroong Estate is now at the head of the businesses, with the highly talented and very experienced Daniel Binet chief winemaker.
