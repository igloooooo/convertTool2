            Partners Sylke Rees and David Miller purchased the 64ha property in 1998 with 7ha of vines already planted to pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and shiraz, all of which came into production in 2002. The entire property, including the vineyard, achieved biodynamic status in 2007. They deliberately irrigate sparingly, the upshot being yields typically 5 tonnes per ha. Exports to Canada, Germany, Denmark and Japan.
