            The name of this business, now entirely based in the Canberra District, reflects an earlier stage of its development, when it also had a property in the Eden Valley. That has now been separated, and Eden Roads operations since 2008 centre on Hilltops, Canberra District and Tumbarumba. At the Royal Melbourne Wine Show 09 Eden Roads The Long Road Hilltops Shiraz 08 was awarded the Jimmy Watson Memorial Trophy; if it needed a higher profile, it now has one. Eden Road has relocated to Murrumbateman, where it purchased the former Doonkuna winery and mature vineyard. Exports to the UK, the US, Maldives and Hong Kong.
