            Geoff (aka Mad Dog) Munzberg, a third-generation grapegrower, joined with Jeremy and Heidi Holmes, Aaron and Kirsty Brasher and son Matthew to create Mad Dog Wines. Management has now passed to Matthew (also carrying the mad dog mantle) after a 25-year apprenticeship. The purchase of a neighbouring vineyard in 2006 has led to the inclusion of some 100-year-old vine fruit, and the range has been extended with small amounts of Sangiovese Exports to the UK, Canada and Denmark.
