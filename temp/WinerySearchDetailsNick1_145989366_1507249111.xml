            Robert and Dale Lee were inspired to plant shiraz on their property after attending a wine dinner at which Port Phillip Estate Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz were served. To the Lees, the Shiraz stood out as quite special, and they were able to obtain 350 cuttings from Port Phillip Estate, which were planted in September 1996. Experimental Shirazs made from these vines in 1999 and 2000 both won medals in the amateur winemaking classes at the Victorian Wines Show, which encouraged the Lees to expand the vineyard. While Robert and Dale continue to make experimental wines from very small estate plantings, the two commercial ranges are sold under the Lewood Estate ($15) and the Anderl &amp; Lee ($20) labels.
