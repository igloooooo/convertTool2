            Peter Manning, general manager of Angas Park Fruits, and wife Vicki moved to Mt McKenzie in the 1990s. His wine consumption soon focused on Barossa Shiraz, and he quickly became a close drinking partner with Domenic Torzi of all things shiraz. By 2004 the Mannings decided it was high time to produce a Barossa Shiraz of their own, and, with the help of Torzi, sourced grapes from three outstanding blocks. The vineyards also include mataro and grenache (thoroughly excusable in the context) and sauvignon blanc.
