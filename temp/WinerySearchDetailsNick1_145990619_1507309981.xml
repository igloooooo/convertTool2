            Patrick and Ann Bertola purchased the property on which the Lion Mill Vineyard now stands in 1996, and began planting the first vines in 1999. The Lilliputian plantings are split fairly equally between shiraz, tempranillo, zinfandel, semillon and cabernet sauvignon, with minor plantings of merlot, petit verdot, durif and graciano. The wines made to date have had significant success in the Perth Hills Wine Show, showing that small can indeed be beautiful.
