            Greg Melick simultaneously wears more hats than most people manage in a lifetime. He is a top-level barrister (Senior Counsel), a Major General (the highest rank in the Australian Army Reserve) and has presided over a number of headline special commissions and enquiries into subjects as diverse as cricket match-fixing allegations against Mark Waugh and others, to the Beaconsfield mine collapse. Yet, if asked, he would probably nominate wine as his major focus in life. Having built up an exceptional cellar of the great wines of Europe, he has turned his attention to grapegrowing and winemaking, planting riesling (2.9ha) at his vineyard on Middle Tea Tree Road in the Coal River Valley. It is a perfect north-facing slope, the Mosel-style Rieslings sweeping all before them. It is moderately certain that Greg is waiting impatiently for his multi-clone pinot noir block to perform in a similar manner. Exports to Singapore.
