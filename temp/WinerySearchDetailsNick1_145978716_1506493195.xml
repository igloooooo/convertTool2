            Mount Gambier lecturer in viticulture Dennis Vice makes small quantities of smooth, melon-accented Chardonnay and rather more of a stylish Coonawarra Cabernet blend; they are sold through local restaurants and the cellar door, with limited Melbourne distribution. The major part of the grape production is sold. Exports to the US, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and China.
