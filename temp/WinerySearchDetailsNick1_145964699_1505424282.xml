            In late 2002 the Bell family acquired a property on the northern slopes of Mt Canobolas at an altitude of approximately 895m. Prior to 1996 the property had been an orchard. With its redevelopment as a vineyard some of the original muscat vines were retained (now about 45 years old) and new plantings of semillon, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon occurred. In 05 a further planting of chardonnay was made and plans to add a similar amount of riesling are underway. This family team, led by son James, regards attention to detail in all areas of the winemaking process as essential; theirs is very much a hands-on operation, especially in relation to vineyard canopy management.
