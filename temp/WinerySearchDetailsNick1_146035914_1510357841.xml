            Albert and Dianne Di Palma began the development of their business in 1987, planting a little under 2ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.7ha of shiraz. They were content to sell their grapes until 1999, but they are now making an increasing amount of wine at their small winery. The wines are also available at the Barossa Small Winemakers Centre at Chateau Tanunda.
