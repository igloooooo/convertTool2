            Sometimes good things come from bad. When Constellation decided to sell (or mothball) its large Padthaway winery, built by Hardys little more than 10 years previously at a cost of $20 million, chief winemaker Sue Bell was summarily retrenched. In quick succession she received a $46,000 wine industry scholarship from the Grape and Wine Research Development Council to study the wine industry in relation to other rural industries in Australia and overseas, and its interaction with community and society. She also became Dux of the Len Evans Tutorial, her prize an extended trip through Bordeaux and Burgundy. She had decided to stay and live in Coonawarra, and the next stroke of good fortune was that a beautiful old shearing shed at Glenroy in Coonawarra came on the market, and will be her winery and cellar door. She is making two wines: a Coonawarra Cabernet and a Tasmanian Chardonnay, having had the opportunity to work with chardonnay from Tasmania, the Yarra Valley and SA while at Stonehaven.
