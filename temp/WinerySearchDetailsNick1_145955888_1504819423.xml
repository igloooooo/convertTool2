            Originally called The Midas Tree, the vineyard was planted in 1984 by Roseworthy graduate John Swanson, who established a 2.5ha vineyard that included zinfandel  15 years ahead of his time. The property was acquired in 1997 by Charles Lane, James Sweetapple and Brian Walters. Since then they have rejuvenated the original vineyard and planted more zinfandel, sauvignon blanc, cabernet and riesling. Exports to the UK and Singapore.
