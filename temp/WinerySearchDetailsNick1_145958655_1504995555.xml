            Irish-born medical practitioner Ken Lynch can be proud of his achievements at Chatsfield, as can the various contract winemakers, who have taken the high quality estate-grown material and made some impressive wines, notably the Riesling and spicy, licorice Shiraz. Exports to the UK and Singapore.
