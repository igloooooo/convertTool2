            The development of the 32.5ha of cabernet sauvignon and 11ha of shiraz (with an addition of 0.5ha of pinot gris planted in 2004) which constitutes the vineyard was exceptionally difficult. It is situated on a terra rossa ridge top, but had unusually thick limestone slabs running through it, which had caused others to bypass the property. A 95-tonne bulldozer was hired to deep-rip the limestone, but was unequal to the task, and ultimately explosives had to be used to create sufficient inroads to allow planting. Only 15% of the production from the vineyard is used by the formidably skilled winemaking team. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
