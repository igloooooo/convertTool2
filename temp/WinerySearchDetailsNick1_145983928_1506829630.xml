            Tony, Julia and Michael Hassall have planted 2ha of shiraz and 1ha of merlot (plus 0.6ha of cabernet sauvignon, tannat and viognier not yet in production) at an altitude of just under 900m in the Granite Belt. They run the vineyard minimising the use of chemicals wherever possible, but do not hesitate to protect the grapes if weather conditions threaten an outbreak of mildew or botrytis. The Hassalls daughter Nikki was very much involved in the creation of the vineyard, and was driving back from university to be there for the first day of picking. By the ultimate cruel finger of fate, the car crashed and she was killed. The Hassalls went on to pick the grapes with our hearts broken; hopefully the quality of the wines has provided some solace.
