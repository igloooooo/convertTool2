            The 4-ha vineyard (with 1 ha each of semillon, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay, and 0.25 ha of chambourcin) is a minor diversification on a beef cattle property set on the edge of the Stuart Range (and which enjoys superb views). It is a small family operation which aims to provide a wine experience for visitors.
