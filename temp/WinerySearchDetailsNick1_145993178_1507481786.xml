            Tony and Bernice OConnell left careers in science and education to establish plantings of shiraz, chardonnay, zinfandel and cabernet sauvignon on their property in 1997. What started off as a fun venture has quickly turned into serious grapegrowing and winemaking. A hands-on approach with low yields has brought out the best characteristics of the grape varieties and the region. Most of the grapes are sold to Fermoy Estate.
