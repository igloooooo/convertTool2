            In 2009 Steve Messiter and wife and Lisa purchased Bald Mountain from its founders, Denis and Jackie Parsons. Steve is a chemical engineer who has a Masters degree and has studied winemaking, and has overseen the complete rejuvenation of the vineyard, including the removal of the lyre trellis and 40% of the vines; some have been grafted over to petit verdot, and albarino is to follow. Mike Hayes (of Symphony Hill) advises on vineyard management and makes the wine. Underwent a name change to Girraween Estate in 2011.
