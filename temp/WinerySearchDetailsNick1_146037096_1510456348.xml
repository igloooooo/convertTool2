            David Bray is one of the doyens of wine journalism in Brisbane, and, indeed, Australia. After decades of writing about wine he and wife Pamela have joined Max Lindsay (Pamelas brother) and partner Lynne Tucker in establishing the Waratah Vineyard at Mungungo, near Monto, at the top of the Burnett Valley. The wines are principally sourced from the Waratah Vineyard, with verdelho, viognier, shiraz, merlot and petit verdot, supplemented by grapes grown at Inglewood and Murgon.
