            Owners of Xabregas, the Hogan family, have five generations of WA history and family interests in sheep grazing and forestry in the Great Southern, dating back to the 1860s. Terry Hogan, founding chairman, felt the Mount Barker region was far too good dirt to waste on blue gums, and vines were planted in 1996. The Hogan family concentrates on the regions strengths  Shiraz and Riesling. Exports to the US, Singapore, Japan, China and NZ.
