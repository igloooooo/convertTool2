            Nookamka Estate Vineyard brings two disparate cultures together. Nookamka was the name given by local Aboriginals to what is now known as Lake Bonney. Nookamka was also the name given to the subdivision in the region created for returned soldiers from the First World War. Bill Kanakaris parents moved from Greece to the Riverland in the early 1960s, gradually establishing a wine grape and table grape production business. Son Bill Kanakaris followed in the footsteps both of his parents and grandfather when he started his own vineyard in the 1980s, initially selling grapes, but commencing wine production in 2002, and the wines were quickly rewarded with a string of bronze medals.
