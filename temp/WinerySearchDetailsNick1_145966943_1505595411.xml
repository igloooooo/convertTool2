            Echelon is the brainchild of Nicholas Crampton, a wine marketer who understands wine (by no means a usual occurrence). He persuaded McWilliams (Echelons owner) to give free rein to his insights, and enlisted the aid of McWilliams chief winemaker Corey Ryan. Ryan relinquished that role on 30 June 2012, but continues to have a consultancy role. Brands under the Echelon umbrella are Last Horizon (single vineyard wines from Tasmania, made by Adrian Sparks), Partisan (from McLaren Vale), Armchair Critic and Under &amp; Over (from established vineyards in the best regions) and Zeppelin (made by Corey Ryan and Kym Teusner, sourced from Barossa vineyards either owned by Teusner or Sons of Eden, and often up to 80 years old). Few wineries in Australia so over-deliver on quality at their price-point.
