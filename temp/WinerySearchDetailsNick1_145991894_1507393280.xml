            Lou Mirandas daughters Lisa and Victoria are the driving force behind the estate,albeit with continuing hands-on involvement from Lou. The jewels in the crown of the estate plantings are 0.5ha of mourvedre planted in 1897 and 1.5ha of shiraz planted in 1907. The remaining vines have been planted gradually since 95, the varietal choice widened by cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay and pinot grigio. The cellar door works on the principle that there should be a wine for every conceivable taste. Exports to the UK and other major markets.
