            John and Myrtle Nolan have established low-yielding, non-irrigated pinot noir using clones 114, 115 and MV6. Myrtle had worked in Yarra Valley vineyards for 10 years across all sectors of the Valley, and (one assumes it is Myrtle who says), John is a faithful supporter of the vineyard endeavours and is highly valued at picking time because of his large and extended family. The vineyard, incidentally, is very close to the Healesville Sanctuary. Smoke taint caused huge problems for Yarra Valley pinot in 09.
