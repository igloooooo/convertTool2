            Clover Hill was established by Taltarni in 1986 with the sole purpose of making a premium sparkling wine. It has 23.9ha of vineyards (chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier) and its sparkling wine quality is excellent, combining finesse with power and length. In 2009 American owner and founder of Clos du Val (Napa Valley),Taltarni and Clover Hill brought the management of these businesses and Domaine de Nizas (Languedoc) under the one management roof; the group is known as Goelet Wine Estates. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
