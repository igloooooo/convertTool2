            Frank and Pamela Osborn are now Mornington Peninsula veterans, having purchased the vineyard land in Ellerina Road in 1988 and (with help from son Guy) planted the vineyard over the following four years. Part of the production from the 5.5 ha of vineyards is sold to others. The wine is fermented at Moorooduc Estate by Richard McIntyre, then matured in barrel at the Osborns barrel store, monitored by Frank Osborn and daughter Lucinda.
