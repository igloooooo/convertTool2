            An important part of the Ellis family business on what was once a large grazing property on the banks of the Derwent. Increased plantings are under contract to Hardys, and a splendid winery has been built to handle the increased production. The winery complex has expansive entertainment and function facilities, plus a large restaurant, and presents an arts and music program. Exports to Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.
