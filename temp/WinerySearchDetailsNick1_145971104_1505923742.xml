            FUSE is a joint venture of the Pikes (Clare Valley), Pike &amp; Joyce (Adelaide Hills) and well-known Melbourne wine distributors Trembath &amp; Taylor. It takes low-cropped grape varieties from terroirs that best suit them: riesling, cabernet, merlot, shiraz, grenache and mourvedre from the Clare Valley; semillon, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay and pinot noir from the Adelaide Hills. Distinctive packaging, and a simple price range, makes the proposition easy to understand. Currently in recess due to shortage of suitable grapes.
