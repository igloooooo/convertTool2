            A substantial family-owned operation (previously known as Cobanov Wines) producing a mix of bulk and bottled wine from 26ha of estate grapes. Part of the annual production is sold as grapes to other producers, including Houghton. Part is sold in bulk, part is sold in 2-litre flagons, and the remainder in modestly priced bottles.
