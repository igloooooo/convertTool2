            Greg and Elaine Searles purchased the property on which they have established Fairview Wines in 1997. For the previous 90 years it had sustained an orchard enterprise. The property currently comprises 2ha of shiraz that consistently produces award winning wine and 0.5ha of verdelho. Organic procedures are used wherever possible to produce the fruit, and minimal sulphites and preservatives are used in the winemaking process.
