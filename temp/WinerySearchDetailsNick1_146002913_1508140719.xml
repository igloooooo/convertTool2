            In 1994 Michael (Mick) Hobson purchased his property situated in the foothills of the Pyrenees on the southern boundary of the region. Planting of shiraz (4ha) began the following year with advice from Southcorp viticulturists Kym Ludvigsen and Stuart McNab. The first few years production was sold to Southcorp, and since 2002 to Mount Langi Ghiran. Most of the grapes are still sold, but the ultimate aim is to use all of the grapes for the Neds Vineyard label.
