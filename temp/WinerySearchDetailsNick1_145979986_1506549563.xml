            Holm Oak takes its name from its grove of oak trees, planted around the beginning of the 20th century and originally intended for the making of tennis racquets. In 2004 Ian and Robyn Wilson purchased the property. The vineyard is planted (in descending order) to pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, riesling, sauvignon blanc and pinot gris, with small amounts of merlot, cabernet franc and arneis. In 2006 the Wilsons daughter Rebecca (with extensive winemaking experience in Australia and California) became winemaker, and husband Tim Duffy (a viticultural agronomist) has taken over management of the vineyard. A winery was completed just in time for the 2007 vintage.
