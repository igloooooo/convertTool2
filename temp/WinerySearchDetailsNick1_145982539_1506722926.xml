            Anna and Chris Dunphy began the development of their vineyard in 1990. They elected to focus solely on pinot noir and have planted 1.8ha of clones 114, 115, MV6 and 777. The vineyard is situated on a north-facing slope near the historic gold mining town of Jamieson and benefits from the hot days and cool nights, which are especially suited to pinot. They say their aim is to make an approachable wine at a realistic price. We want Jameaux [their pinot] to be a signature that is a mixture of French sensibility and Australian larrakin-ism.
