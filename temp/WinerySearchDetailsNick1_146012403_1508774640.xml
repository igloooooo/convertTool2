            Shane and Michelle Mead say they have wine in their blood. Michelles brother is Darrin Gaffy of Principia Wines on the Mornington Peninsula, and uncle Brian Gaffy has Clair de Lune in South Gippsland. Shane came onboard with his first memorable tasting of a Langi Ghiran Shiraz; it was this that led to the search for a suitable vineyard site in the Pyrenees. Plantings began in 1995, and Shane and Michelle moved up from Melbourne with their very young family in 99, expanding the plantings of shiraz and also planting viognier. The standard of the labelling and packaging matches the high quality of the wines.
