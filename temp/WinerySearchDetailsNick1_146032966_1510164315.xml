            Domenic Torzi and Tracy Matthews, former Adelaide Plains residents, searched for a number of years before finding a block at Mt McKenzie in the Eden Valley. The block they chose is in a hollow; the soil is meagre, and they were in no way deterred by the knowledge that it would be frost-prone. The result is predictably low yields, concentrated further by drying the grapes on racks and reducing the weight by around 30% (the Appassimento method is used in Italy to produce Amarone-style wines). Four wines are made: Riesling and Shiraz under both the Frost Dodger and Schist Rock labels, the Shiraz wild yeastfermented and neither fined nor filtered. Newer plantings of sangiovese and negroamaro, and an extension of the original plantings of shiraz and riesling, is likely to see the wine range increase in the future. Exports to the US, Denmark, Singapore and Hong Kong.
