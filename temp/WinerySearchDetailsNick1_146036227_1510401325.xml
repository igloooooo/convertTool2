            In 1962 the Virgara family  father Michael, mother Maria and 10 children ranging from one to 18 years old  migrated to Australia from southern Italy. Through the hard work so typical of many such families, in due course they became market gardeners on land purchased at Angle Vale (1967), and in the early 90s acquired an existing vineyard in Angle Vale. The plantings have since expanded to almost 70ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, grenache, malbec, merlot, riesling, sangiovese, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio and alicante, with a further 22ha currently under a replanting project. In 2001 the Virgara brothers purchased the former Barossa Valley Estates winery, but used it only for storage and maturation, as the first wine was made (in 02 from 40-year-old shiraz) by the Glaetzer family. The death of Domenic Virgara in a road accident led to the employment of former Palandri winemaker (and, before that, Tahbilk)Tony Carapetis,and the full commissioning of the winery. Exports to the US, Canada, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan.
