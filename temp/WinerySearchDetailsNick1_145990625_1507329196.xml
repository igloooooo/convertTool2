            The 4ha Little Cathedral vineyard was planted in 1996 under the lee of the striking Cathedral Ranges at Taggerty. It has been established on a gentle north-facing slope at an altitude of 280m, and should irrigation be required, it comes from the gin-clear Little River, a mountain stream that originates deep within the forest that the vineyard backs onto. Since Madge Alexandra and Anna Pickworth acquired the property in 2006, it has been a sharp learning curve. Drought and frost destroyed the 07 vintage, and when the surrounding forest was burnt in February 09, smoke taint destroyed the crop. 2008 and 10 have been the standouts, 11 confronted by the abnormally cool and wet growing season. Nonetheless, it is a truly beautiful vineyard and is capable of producing pinot noir of high quality.
