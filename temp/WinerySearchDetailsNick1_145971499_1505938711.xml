            Galli Estate, founded in 1997 by (the late) Lorenzo and Pam Galli, is located at Rockbank in Sunbury, with 50ha of vines (chardonnay, shiraz, pinot grigio, cabernet sauvignon and merlot) planted on rich red volcanic soil. The Camelback Vineyard at Heathcote has 110ha planted to a mix of mainstream and Mediterranean varieties (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, sangiovese, viognier, tempranillo, nebbiolo, merlot, grenache and petit verdot). All wines are estate-grown. Following the death of Lorenzo it was decided to substantially downsize the operation by reducing the make, and selling more of the grapes. Exports to the UK, Canada, Singapore, China and Hong Kong.
