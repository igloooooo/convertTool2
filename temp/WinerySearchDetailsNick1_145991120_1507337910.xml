            Littore Family Wines was founded by Mario and Aurora Littore on the Murray River near Mildura, the first vineyard named Jindalee, meaning bare hill. A decade later the winery capacity was increased from 3 million to 13 million litres (15 000 tonnes). Sons Vince and David had purchased the Idyll Vineyard (now Jindalee Estate) near Geelong, which is now the headquarters of the group, and oversaw the expansion in the Riverland (here the group owns 1400ha planted to 23 varieties; the Geelong vineyards a paltry 16ha). The wines now come under a number of labels for its domestic and numerous export markets. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
