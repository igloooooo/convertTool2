            Martin Bastick could not have imagined the success which would follow when he planted pinot noir on his small property at Birchs Bay alongside the DEntrecasteaux Channel, southwest of Hobart. Its original use in 1815 was as a convict settlement, and thereafter the site of a signal station from the 1830s onwards. A soldiers button of the 11th Regiment of Foot, the North Devonshires The Bloody 11th, was unearthed at the signal post site. Thus the winery labels bear an image of an officer of the 11th Regiment of that period, and the Pinot Noir is called the Bloody Eleventh. The 2008 Bloody Eleventh Pinot Noir won the top gold medal of class in the Hobart Wine Show 09, gold medal at the Tasmanian Wine Show 10, and top gold and three trophies at the Tasmanian Wine Show 11.
