            Metier is the French word for craft, trade or profession; the business is that of Yarra Valley based Martin Williams, who has notched up an array of degrees and had winemaking stints in France, California and Australia, which are, not to put too fine a word on it, extraordinary. The focus of Metier is on individual vineyard wines. Production has decreased as Martin Williams has moved beyond his role as a winemaker. Exports to Hong Kong.
