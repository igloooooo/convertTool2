            After 90 years of beef and dairy farming heritage, Murray Burton ventured into premium grapegrowing and winemaking in 1977. Today the venture he founded has two large vineyards in Frankland River planted to the leading varieties, the lions share to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, merlot and semillon, with a small but important planting of malbec. The operation centres around the Ferngrove Vineyard, where a large rammed-earth winery and tourist complex was built in 2000. Part of the vineyard production is sold as grapes, part as juice or must, part as finished wine, and the pick of the crop is made for the Ferngrove label. The consistency of its wines across a wide range of price points is wholly admirable. Acquired Killerby (Margaret River) in 2008. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
