            Andrew and Jane Elek, the former a consultant in international economic policy, the latter a biologist and entomologist, have established 0.5ha of vineyard, planted equally to chardonnay and pinot noir. The name Bellendena comes from the botanical name of a native Tasmanian plant, Bellendena montana, commonly known as Mountain Rocket. The label depicts the red seed capsules of the plant viewed from above.
