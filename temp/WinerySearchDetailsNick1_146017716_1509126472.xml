            Peter Rumball has been making and selling sparkling wine for as long as I can remember, but has led a somewhat peripatetic life, starting in the Clare Valley but now operating one of the larger Traditional Method lines in Australia, in the Adelaide suburb of Norwood. His particular speciality has always been Sparkling Shiraz, and was so long before it became flavour of the month. Exports to the UK, US and Japan.
