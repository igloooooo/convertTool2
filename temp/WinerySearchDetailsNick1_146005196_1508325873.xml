            The full name of this enterprise is Orange Highland Wines &amp; Gardens, the gardens the lifelong passion of Helen Harrison, supported by former banker husband Ross. Having started in Sydney, they moved to the Adelaide Hills in 1979, Helen then teaching music in high school, and Ross continuing his career as a banker. Over the next 20 years Helen created a large garden, but a chance trip through the Central Ranges brought them to Orange, and their retirement vision took shape. They moved in 2004, buying a property that had a single native tree and a peculiar covenant that they could only build a house if they practised irrigated agriculture. So, in addition to the garden, they planted sauvignon blanc, pinot gris and pinot noir, recently adding sangiovese (the first vintage in 10). The 1.8ha of gardens established by Helen are designed in themed rooms, and were one of the 12 finalists in the ABC Gardener of the Year competition 08. They are augmented by displays from time to time,including sculpture exhibitions.
