            Former audiologist Jan Milhinch is a great-great-granddaughter of GF Morris, founder of the most famous Rutherglen wine family. She was in her 50s and at the height of her professional career when she decided to take what she describes as a vine change, moving from Melbourne to establish a little over 3ha of durif, orange muscat, brown muscat and viognier on a quartz-laden red clay slope, planted in 2002, but with a viticultural history stretching back to 1890. Son Rowland has joined the winemaking team.
