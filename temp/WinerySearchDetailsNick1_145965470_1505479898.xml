            Chemical engineer Andreas Greiving had a lifelong dream to own and operate a vineyard, and the opportunity came along with the global financial crisis. He was able to purchase a vineyard planted to shiraz (7ha), cabernet sauvignon (2ha), cabernet franc, durif and viognier (1ha each), and have the wines contract-made. The venture is co-managed by dentist wife Hennijati. Exports to the UK.
