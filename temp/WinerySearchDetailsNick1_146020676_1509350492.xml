            When Tony and Margot Sharpe planted their vineyard in 1998, the wheel of fortune turned a sharp 180 degrees. Their ancestors, strict Methodists, established Sharpe Bros cordials in 1868 to provide the working man with an alternative to the demon alcohol at the end of his working day. The vicissitudes of this life of wine are reflected in the names of their wines: Shattered Margot, Battered Sauv, Gentlemans Claret (a nod to the forebears), Lazy Rosy, Redemption Chardonnay and Just Franc (cabernet franc).
