            Established by John Boucher and partner Pauline Russell in the shadow of Black Mountain, an ideal environment for pinot noir and chardonnay vines. With five generations of winemaking behind them, John and Luke Boucher continue the quest for quality and refinement. Being boutique winemakers, they maintain the traditional hand-making processes that complement the character of the wines. New facilities have recently been introduced to enhance the production process for all the sparkling wines. The additional production capacity gives the opportunity to source additional suitable quality parcels of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon from the Macedon and Heathcote regions.
