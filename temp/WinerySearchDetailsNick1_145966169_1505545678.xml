            Since it was established thirty years ago, Dromana Estate has always been near or at the cutting edge, both in marketing terms and in terms of development of new varietals, most obviously the Italian range under the i label. Dromana Estate is owned by the investors of a publicly listed company, operating under the name of Mornington Winery Group Limited. It includes the Dromana Estate, Mornington Estate and David Traeger (see separate entry) labels. Expanded production has seen export markets increase. Exports to the US, Canada and China.
