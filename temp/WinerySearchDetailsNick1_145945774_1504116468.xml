            In 1993 David Traeger acquired a vineyard he had coveted for many years, and which had been planted by Baptista Governa in 1891. He had been buying grapes from the vineyard since 1988, but it was in a run-down condition, and required a number of years rehabilitation before he felt the quality of the grapes was sufficient. Is jointly owned by Traeger and the Wine Investment Fund, the latter a majority shareholder in Dromana Estate. Exports to the UK, Singapore and Japan.
