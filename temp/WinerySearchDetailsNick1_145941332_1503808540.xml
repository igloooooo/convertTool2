            In December 2005Warwick and Cherylyn Mathews acquired the long-established Hopelands Vineyard, planted to cabernet sauvignon (2.6ha), shiraz (1.6ha), merlot, semillon, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay (1.1ha each). The first wine was made in 06, after which they decided to completely rework the vineyard, requiring many hours of physical labour. The vines were cut right and retrained, with a consequent reduction in yield and rise in wine quality.
