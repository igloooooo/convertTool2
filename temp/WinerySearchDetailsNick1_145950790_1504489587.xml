            The wheel comes full circle with Boora Estate, where Frank Ramsay has established approximately 0.5ha each of chardonnay, semillon, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, tempranillo and shiraz. In the 1870s and 1880s Dubbo supported a significant winemaking industry, with Eumalga Estate (owned and run by French-born JE Serisier) said (by the local newspaper of the time) to have the second-largest winery in Australia (which I doubt). Another highly successful winery was established by German-born Frederich Kurtz; Mount Olive won a number of awards in international exhibitions in the 1880s.
