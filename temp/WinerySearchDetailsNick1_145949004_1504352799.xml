            Founder and winemaker Ken Jones was formerly a geneticist and molecular biologist at Edinburgh University, so the chemistry of winemaking comes easily. The estate-based wine comes from 2ha of pinot noir (clones MV6 and D5V12); the other wines are made from purchased grapes grown in various parts of Central Victoria.  Exports to China.
