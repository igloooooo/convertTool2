            For many years, until the opening of Stonehaven, this was the only functioning winery in Padthaway, in a large and gracious old stone woolshed set in the superb grounds of the estate; the homestead is in the Relais et Chteaux mould, offering luxurious accommodation and fine food. Sparkling wines are the speciality. Padthaway Estate also acts as a tasting centre for other Padthaway-region wines.
