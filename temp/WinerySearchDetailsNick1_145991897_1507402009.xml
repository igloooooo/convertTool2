            It is ironic that the winery name should have associations with Alfa Laval, the giant Swiss food and wine machinery firm. Roy Meyer runs an organic vineyard (using only sulphur and copper sprays) and is proud of the fact that the winery has no refrigeration and no stainless steel. The wines produced from the 2.5-ha vineyard are fermented in open barrels or cement tanks, and maturation is handled entirely in oak.
