            Since the latter part of the 1990s, Summerhill Wines has successfully gone through various crises. Having started with 6 tonnes of grapes in 1998 producing a mix of multi-regional wines, vintage doubled each succeeding year, reaching 80 tonnes in 2002. Since then they have largely focused on their Mornington Peninsula vineyard and winery, with pinot noir and shiraz grown on the sandy soils of the Somerville area. The overwhelming percentage is sold on-premise, and Summerhill also provides contract winemaking services for (among others) Rubicon, Pyramid Gold, Oakdale and Corniola. Exports to Malaysia.
