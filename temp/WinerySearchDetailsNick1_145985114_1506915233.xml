            The vineyard is at Wonga Park, one of the gateways to the Yarra Valley, and has a picnic area and a full-scale restaurant. A very competent producer of both cider and apple brandy (in Calvados style) as well as table wine. When it received its winery licence in 1960, it became the first winery in the Yarra Valley to open its doors in the 20th century, a distinction often ignored or forgotten (by this author as well as others). Rob Hall, former Mount Mary winemaker, has joined the Kellys as winemaker, and it will be interesting to watch the development of the wines given his background. Exports to the UK and Denmark.
