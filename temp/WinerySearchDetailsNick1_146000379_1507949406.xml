            The first vines were planted in 1988 by Dinny Killen on a site on her family property that had been especially recommended by Dr Edgar Riek; its attractions were red soil of volcanic origin over limestone, with reasonably steep east and northeast slopes providing an element of frost protection. The tiny vineyard established in 88 has been significantly expanded since it was purchased in 99. The pre-existing blocks of pinot noir, chardonnay and merlot have all been increased, and have been joined by pinot gris, shiraz, tempranillo, riesling, graciano, cabernet franc and touriga. In additional, there has been an active planting program for the pinot noir, introducing Dijon clones 114, 155 and 777.
