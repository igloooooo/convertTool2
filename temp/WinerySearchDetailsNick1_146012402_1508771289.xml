            Owner Dean Terrell is the ex-Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University and a Professor of Economics. The acquisition of the property, originally used as a quarry for the construction of the Barton Highway and thereafter as a grazing property, was the brainchild of his family, who wanted to keep him active in retirement from full-time academic and administrative life. The vineyard was established in 1999, with further plantings in 2001 and 06; there are 1.75ha of shiraz, 1ha of sauvignon blanc, 0.75ha of tempranillo, 0.5ha each of grenache and pinot noir, and, and 1.5ha split between savagnin, mataro, sangiovese, sagrantino, cinsaut and roussanne. The first commercial vintage followed in 06 after two trial vintages; small plantings of other alternative varieties have followed. Only part of the production is released under the Quarry Hill label, as grapes are sold to wineries including Clonakilla and Collector Wines.
