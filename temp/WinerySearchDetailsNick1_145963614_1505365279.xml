            Improbably, was once one of the largest Perth Hills vineyards, but no more. It has 4 ha of pinot noir and 0.5 ha of shiraz, continuing the near obsession of the Perth Hills vignerons with pinot noir in a climate which, to put it mildly, is difficult for the variety, other than in sparkling wine.
