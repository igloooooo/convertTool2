            Planting of the 8ha vineyard began in 1984 on a north-facing slope of red basalt soil which runs at the 550m elevation line; it is believed the hill was the site of a volcanic eruption 7 million years ago. The vines were established without the aid of irrigation (and remain unirrigated), and produced the first small crop in 1990. No grapes were produced between 1993 and 95 owing to mildew: Murphy and OShea say, We tried to produce fruit with no sprays at all, and learned the hard way. Part of the production is sold to others, all of whom attest to the quality of the fruit. Exports to the UK, Canada, Germany, Singapore and Hong Kong.
