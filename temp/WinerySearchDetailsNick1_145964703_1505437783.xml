            When Jeff and Lisa Laycock planted 1.6ha of albarino in 2005 they, along with various other enthusiasts around Australia, had no idea the variety was in fact savagnin, no relation whatsoever to the albarino they thought they were planting. After some highly-publicised soul-searching by other growers (all good promotional material anyway) it was clear there was nothing left but to either use the correct name, or simply give a generic. Why did no one use Fools Gold? Be that as it may, and with 10ha of shiraz as the real business, albeit not for Dirt Road Vignerons at this stage, Nathan Norman made several hundred dozen of savagnin, naming it The Debacle.
