            Timothy OCallaghan explains that his family crest is an Irish hound standing under an oak tree; the Diggers Bluff label features his faithful hound Digger under a mallee tree. He is a third-generation OCallaghan winemaker, and  reading his newsletter  its not too hard to guess who the second generation is represented by. Diggers Bluff has cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, grenache, alicante and mataro, all old vines. Exports to Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand.
