            The Little family has established sauvignon blanc, semillon, cabernet sauvignon (2ha each) and shiraz (1ha), with a certified organic grapegrowing program. No chemical-based fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides are used in the vineyard, building humus and biological activity in the soil. Given that the vineyard produces 50 tonnes per year, it is evident that the approach has worked well. The cellar door (opened Dec 2007) has a unique air-conditioning system provided by 13 750 recycled wine bottles filled with water, producing a cooling effect in summer, and a warming effect in winter.
