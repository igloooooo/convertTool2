            Having sold Elsewhere Vineyard, Eric and Jette Phillips have planted the former flower gardens around the old Elsewhere homestead, where they still live, exclusively to pinot noir, and renamed this 1ha retirement vineyard No Regrets. After a slow restart, their Pinots are now resembling those of Elsewhere.
