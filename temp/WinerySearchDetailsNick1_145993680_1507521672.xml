            A member of the famous Morris family, Rick Morris shuns publicity and relies virtually exclusively on cellar door sales for what is a small output. He may shun publicity, but does so with grace, and his Old Tawny (he wont be able to used the adjunct Port for much longer) is a very good wine.
