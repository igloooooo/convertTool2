            Following the March 2008 sale of their very large vineyard and vine nursery propagation business, Bruce and Jenny Chalmers have established twin wine businesses, both commenced in 08. They have an 80ha property on the Mt Camel Range at Colbinabbin, with the wines released under the Montevecchio label: Bianco is a co-fermented field blend made from vermentino, fiano and a splash of moscato giallo; Rosso is a co-fermented field blend of shiraz, lagrein, nero dAvola and sagrantino; Moscato is made from 100% moscato giallo. The second property is a 10ha vineyard at Merbein, just outside Mildura, with commercial blocks of vermentino, sagrantino and nero dAvola. The fourth block contains every single clone and variety Chalmers imported over its decades-long involvement in the industry. With a couple of additional direct imports, micro-vinification will see wines made from varieties never previously made in Australia. The plans are to make the wines onsite, with minimal winemaking intervention, and make exclusive releases, some as small as 20 or 50 litres. Exports to the UK and Denmark.
