            To quote: Mount Burrumboot Estate was born in 1999, when Andrew and Cathy Branson planted vines on the Home Block of the Branson family farm, Donore, on the slopes of Mt Burrumboot, on the Mt Camel Range, above Colbinabbin. Originally the vineyard was just another diversification of an already diverse farming enterprise. However, the wine bug soon bit, and so a winery was established. The first wine was contract-made in 2001  however, 02 saw the first wine made by Cathy in the machinery shed, surrounded by headers and tractors. Very primitive, and the appearance of the new 50-tonne winery in 02 was greeted with great enthusiasm! And then you taste the wines. Amazing. The original plantings of a little over 11ha of shiraz and merlot have since been expanded to take in lesser amounts of petit verdot, sangiovese, tempranillo, gamay, marsanne and viognier. There is no intention to expand the business further.
