            The 4.5ha vineyard of Rangemore Estate, planted to verdelho, shiraz, cabernet and merlot, is high in the southern foothills of the Bunya Mountains. The soil is a sandy loam over sandstone, and the low-yielding vines are grown with little or no irrigation. The founding Allen family operates a cellar door and caf, with B&amp;B accommodation, offering spectacular views of the Bunya Mountains.
