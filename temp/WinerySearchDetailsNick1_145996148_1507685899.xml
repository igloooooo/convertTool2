            David and Dianne McKenzie have planted 2ha of shiraz and 1ha of merlot on a mix of granitic soil and rock, 16km southwest of Heathcote at an elevation of 340m. The dry-grown vines are low-yielding, and it is not expected that production will exceed 150 dozen. The windy site means that sprays are seldom required, but the growth of the merlot has been savaged by local wildlife.
