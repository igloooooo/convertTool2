            The eight-variety vineyard of Barton Creek has been established on the Nyrang Homestead property. The bluestone home was built in the first few years of the 20th century, and contains 36 rooms including seven bathrooms, seven guest rooms, a grand dining room, butlers pantry and wine cellar. It is surrounded by 2ha of gardens, the plants direct descendants of those first planted. Then there is a school house (available as studio-style accommodation), a coach house, stables, shearing shed, grooms cottage, milking bale and a modern machinery shed. Since 1996 it has been owned by Stephen Sykes and Greg Urbansky, who have undertaken extensive conservation work on the property.
