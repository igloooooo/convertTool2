            Dom and Dianne Perri purchased their 4ha property (with secure water rights) in 1978, intending to grow grapes. Raising three daughters caused the grape project to be delayed, and it was not until 1997 that they established their vineyard of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, cabernet franc and frontignac. The direct inspiration was Doms father, Antonio, who made wine for consumption by the family. Dom produced his first wine in 2000, and in 04 was the most successful exhibitor (and trophy winner) at the Victorian Wines Shows amateur classes (for a cabernet sauvignon), two years later winning the award for Best White Wine in the amateur section of the show, doing even better at the Dookie Wine Show, winning the trophy for Best White Wine in Show. His skill as a winemaker was a result of completing a four-year diploma of wine technology course at the Dookie Campus of Melbourne University, wife Dianne also completing a post-fermentation short course at Dookie.
