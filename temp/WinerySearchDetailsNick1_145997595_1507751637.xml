            Mintaro Wines vineyards were planted in 1962, and were incorporated into a functioning winery complex in 85 by the present owner and winemaker, Peter Houldsworth. There are five vineyards in the Mintaro and Polish Hill districts of the Clare Valley, one-third planted to riesling, the remainder divided equally between cabernet sauvignon and shiraz. Wines are released under the Mintaro and Monarch of Montaro labels. Exports to Singapore.
