            Jack and Gill Cotton began planting the Kelvedon Vineyard with 1ha of pinot noir in 1998. The Cotton family has owned and managed the historic East Coast property since 1829, grapegrowing coming very late in the piece. The plantings were extended in 200001 by an additional 5 ha, half to pinot noir and half to chardonnay, followed by a further 2ha of chardonnay in 10. The chardonnay and 1ha of pinot noir plantings are under contract to Accolade Wines. One ha of sauvignon blanc has also been established to provide a second wine under the Kelvedon label; the Pinot Noir can be of excellent quality.
