            Owners Wayne Peterson and Lorraine Brinkman have a modestly sized vineyard, with 0.7ha each of cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, but had to undergo the labours of Hercules before planting the vineyard. First came the rebuilding of an access bridge, then dealing with mammoth amounts of blackberry to uncover Treen Brook, which runs through the property, and finally removing 30 tonnes of rock turned up by ploughing prior to planting in 2002. Consolation came in the form of a cellar door in 2006, allowing visitors to revel in the natural beauty of the picturesque valley setting. Two-thirds of the grapes are sold, one-third used to make the Flamebird wines.
