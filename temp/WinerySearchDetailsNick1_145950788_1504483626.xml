            Julie and Phil Hutton put their money where their hearts are, electing to plant a merlot-only vineyard in 1996. Presumably knowing the unpredictable habits of merlot when planted on its own roots, they began by planting 3500 Swartzman rootstock vines, and then 12 months later field-grafting the merlot scion material. Small wonder their backs are still aching. I dont doubt for a millisecond the sincerity of their enthusiasm for the variety when they say, Fruity, plummy, smooth and velvety. Hints of chocolate too. If youre new to wine and all things merlot, this is a wonderful variety to explore. A classic red, known for its go-anywhere, please-everyone style, it makes a welcome place for itself at any table. And the frogs? Well, apparently they bonk  loudly.
