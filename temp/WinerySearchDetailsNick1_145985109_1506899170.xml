            Second in size only to Wynns Coonawarra Estate in the region, Katnook has made significant strides since its acquisition by Freixinet; at one time selling most of its grapes, it now sells a maximum of 10%. The historic stone woolshed in which the second vintage in Coonawarra (1896) was made, and which has served Katnook since 1980, has been restored. Likewise, the former office of John Riddoch has been fully restored and is now the cellar door, and the former stables (likewise fully restored) now serve as a function area. Well over half the total estate plantings are cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, other varieties of importance being chardonnay, merlot, sauvignon blanc and pinot noir. The Odyssey Cabernet Sauvignon and Prodigy Shiraz are the icon duo at the top of a multitiered production. Freixenet, the Spanish Cava producer, now owns 100% of the business. Exports to all major markets.
