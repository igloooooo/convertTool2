            Affleck is owned by the Hendry family, the name a corruption of the Scottish achadh-nan-leac, which means field of stones, a property in Scotland occupied by the Hendry family for more than 250 years. Planting of the vineyard began in 1976, and there are now 4ha of semillon, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet and merlot, with a small number of muscat vines. It is situated on the shale of the Lake George Escarpment, at an altitude of 800m. Picking takes place around April/May, firmly putting it in the cool climate brigade. Barbecue and picnic areas are available, but buses and groups only by appointment.
