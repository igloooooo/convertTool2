            Sydney barrister Paul Blacket and wife Christine purchased the Lenswood Vineyard from Tim and Annie Knappstein in 2004. Planting of the chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, semillon, gewurztraminer and pinot noir had begun in 1981 and continued through to 2005, and has been under the care of the same vineyard manager for the past 20 years. The Blackets also acquire pinot noir and shiraz from a neighbouring high-altitude Adelaide Hills vineyard, with an Eden Valley Riesling in the planning pipeline, plus shiraz and cabernet partly owned by them with members of the Kilikanoon group and others. TK Wines is also owned by Paul Blacket; production is now focused solely on the Lenswood vineyards.
