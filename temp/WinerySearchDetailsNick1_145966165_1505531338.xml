            Graeme Gibson and his partners are developing Drews Creek step by step. The initial planting of 2ha of chardonnay and 3ha of merlot was in 1991, and the first grapes were produced in 93; a further 2.5ha of sangiovese were planted in 99. Most of the grapes are sold to contract winemaker David Lowe, but a small quantity of wine is made for sale to friends and through the mailing list.
