            Doc Adams is a partnership between viticulturist Adam Jacobs and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Darren Waters (and their respective wives). Adam graduated from CSU with a degree in viticulture and has had over 20 years experience as a consultant viticulturist, first in the Mornington Peninsula and then McLaren Vale, Coonawarra, Adelaide Hills and Langhorne Creek. Darren has grown low-yielding shiraz vines in McLaren Vale since 1998, using all of his time off from his surgical practice. The estate-grown Shiraz is open-fermented, and is matured in 80% new French and 20% new American oak for 18 months. The Pinot Gris comes from a single low-yielding Adelaide Hills vineyard; the wine is given 24 hours skin contact, which leads to the light-golden colour and palate richness. Exports to China.
