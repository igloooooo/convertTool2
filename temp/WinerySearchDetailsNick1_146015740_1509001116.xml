            Following the acquisition of the former Eyton-on-Yarra by Helmut Konecsny, major changes occurred. Most obvious is the renaming of the winery and brand, slightly less so the move of the winemaking operations of Rochford from the Macedon Ranges to the Yarra Valley. Rochford has 30.55ha of vineyards in the Macedon Ranges,and just under 15ha in the Yarra Valley, with a heavy focus on chardonnay and pinot noir. The large restaurant is open seven days for lunch and Rochford is well known for the numerous concerts it stages in its lakeside amphitheatre. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Sweden, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
