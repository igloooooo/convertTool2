            David and Julie Cheesley purchased the property in the early 1990s, planting 6ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon in 94, adding 0.5ha of merlot in 2000. Since that time, 0.8ha of cabernet sauvignon has been replaced by equal quantities of merlot on grafted rootstock and grenache planted in 10. The vines are planted on terraced sloping hills, the wind exposure helping the Cheesleys organic management of the vineyard. The Willunga name and the Black Duck brand come from the Aboriginal word willangga, which means black duck. The cellar door is a refurbished circa 1850 building in the town of Willunga Exports to the UK, the US, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.
