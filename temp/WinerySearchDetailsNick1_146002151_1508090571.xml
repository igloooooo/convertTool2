            Having left the Adelaide Hills in 1988 with their three children, Patricia and Geoff Porter returned 10 years later to purchase an old dairy farm at Birdwood. Since then the entire family has worked tirelessly to progressively establish a large vineyard planted to chardonnay (12.3ha), sauvignon blanc (8.4ha), shiraz (3.9ha), two clones of pinot noir (4ha), merlot (1.9ha) and pinot gris (1.8ha). Almost all of the grape production is sold to other Adelaide Hills makers, with small quantities of wines contract-made.
