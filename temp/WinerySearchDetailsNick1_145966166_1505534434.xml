            Driftwood Estate is a well-established landmark on the Margaret River scene. Quite apart from offering a brasserie restaurant capable of seating 200 people (open seven days for lunch and dinner) and a mock Greek open-air theatre, its wines feature striking and stylish packaging and opulent flavours. The winery architecture is, it must be said, opulent rather than stylish. Exports to the UK, the US and Singapore.
