            Robyne and Ross Trimboli hit the jackpot with their 2000 vintage red wines, sourced from various regions in SA, including one described by Robert Parker Jr as Barotta, the most northerly region in SA (it is in fact Baroota, and is not the most northerly), with Parker points ranging between 91 and 95. One of the wines was a Late Harvest Shiraz, tipping the scales at 17% alcohol, and contract-grown at Kangaroo Island. It is here that the Trimbolis have established their own vineyard, planted to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, pinot noir and pinot gris. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Denmark, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
