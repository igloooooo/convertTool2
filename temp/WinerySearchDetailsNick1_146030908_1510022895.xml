            Merv and Dawne Thomas thought long and hard before purchasing the property on which they have established their vineyard. It is 3km from the coast of the Gulf of St Vincent on the Fleurieu Peninsula, with a clay over limestone soil known locally as Bay of Biscay. They had a dream start to the business when the 2004 Shiraz won the trophy for Best Single Vineyard Wine (red or white) at the McLaren Vale Wine Show 05, the Reserve Shiraz also winning a gold medal. Exports to the US, Hong Kong and Singapore.
