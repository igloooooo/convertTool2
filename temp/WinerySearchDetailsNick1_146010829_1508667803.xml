            Ever the professional, David Clarke had made steps for the sale of Pooles Rock prior to his death in April 2012. Discussions with neighbour Brian Agnew, owner of Audrey Wilkinson, led to an agreement between the Clarke and Agnew families for Pooles Rock to be acquired by the Agnew interests. The two wineries will keep their separate identities, and winemakers Jeff Byrne and Usher Tinkler will continue in their roles at Audrey Wilkinson and Pooles Rock respectively. James Agnew, general manager of Audrey Wilkinson, will also become general manager of Pooles Rock. The original vineyard, in the Broke Fordwich subregion, was controversially sold to AGL, currently exploring for coal seam gas in the area. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
