            Mark Haisma has established 2ha of dry-grown pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot on a small hillside vineyard on Briarty Road. This is not a coincidence; Mark is co-winemaker with owner Dr Bailey Carrodus at Yarra Yering. Haisma practises what might be described as non-interventionist winemaking (wild yeast, gravity movement, etc) with the aim of allowing the full expression of varietal character.
