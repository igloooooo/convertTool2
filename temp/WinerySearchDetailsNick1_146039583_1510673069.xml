            This venture is now solely owned by Liberty Wines UK, sourcing its grapes from McLaren Vale and from Adelaide Hills (pinot gris and a portion of its viognier). Tim James has come on board as consultant winemaker, Kate Day continuing in the executive role. The business has export links to many parts of the world in addition to the UK.
