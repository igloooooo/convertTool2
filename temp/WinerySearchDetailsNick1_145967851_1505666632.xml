            Bindy and Chris Elsmore purchased their 16ha property at Broke in 1995, subsequently establishing a little over 4ha of chardonnay, verdelho and shiraz, with chardonnay taking the lions share of the plantings. Their interest in wine came not from their professional lives  Chris is a retired commodore of the RAN and Bindy had a career in advertising, marketing and personnel  but from numerous trips to the wine regions of France, Italy and Spain.
