            Harcourt Valley Vineyards (planted 1975) has the oldest planting of vines in the Harcourt Valley. Using 100% estate-grown fruit Quinn Livingstone (second-generation winemaker) is making a number of small-batch wines from the property. The vines are hand-tended and minimal fruit handling is used in the winemaking process. A new tasting area overlooks the vines, and has a large window that allows visitors to see the activity in the winery. In 2011 Harcourt Valley won seven trophies at regional wine shows, four for the 2009 Barbaras Shiraz, others by the 2010 Riesling and 2010 Sightings Shiraz. Exports to China.
