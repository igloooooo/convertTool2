            The former Duerdens Wines was purchased by Andrea Sutherland and Frank Falco in 2003, and renamed Sawtooth Ridge. The unique overhead sawtooth trellis (a traditional structure in parts of Italy) remains unchanged, and the panoply of conventional wines, liqueurs (including quandong), syrups, honeys, jelly and vinegar remain available.
