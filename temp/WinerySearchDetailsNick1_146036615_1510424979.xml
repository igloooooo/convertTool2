            Paul and Chris Robey moved to Walla Walla in 1981 after working in Papua New Guinea, the NT and at Puckapunyal in Vic. Paul is an agriculturist and teacher; Chris is a registered nurse. After making wine as a hobby for some years, they planted the vineyard to semillon, shiraz, taminga and tarrango. Paul has completed a graduate diploma in viticulture at CSU, and has also completed short courses in winemaking at the Dookie campus of Melbourne University. The pair do all the vineyard and winemaking operations except bottling.
