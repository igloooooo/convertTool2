            It pays to have a keenly developed sense of humour if you are a small winemaker committed to producing the very best possible wine regardless of cost and market constraints. The short version (and I quote) is: Warick (sic) Gerrard, owner/consumer; Jan McIntosh, winemaker and life partner; Danny Edwards, viticulture and adopted son; 60ha of central Wilyabrup land, two houses and 60 cows; 4ha of spoilt vines and 600 dozen of red wine. There is a much longer version, underlining Dannys freedom to organically grow the vines with limited irrigation limiting yield and maximising quality, and Jans freedom to buy as much French oak as she wishes. The outcome is four clones of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, malbec, petit verdot and semillon in the 500-dozen make-up, selling for the ludicrously low price of $120 per dozen plus postage. Verging on surreal is the fact that the red wines mature for 1416 months in 30% new and 70% used French oak barriques.
