            The Politini family have been grapegrowers in the King Valley supplying major local wineries since 1989, selling to Brown Brothers, Miranda and the Victorian Alps Winery. In 2000 they decided to move into winemaking, and have steadily increased their wine production to its present level. They have also planted pinot gris, sangiovese, vermentino, nero dAvola and grecanico (garganega) to accompany the previously planted cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot and sauvignon blanc. Luis Simian is a winemaker with a significant track record of success in many places, including Chile. Exports to Hong Kong and China.
