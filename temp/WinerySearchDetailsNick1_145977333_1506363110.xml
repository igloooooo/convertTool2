            James Hastwell (son of Mark and Wendy Hastwell of Hastwell &amp; Lightfoot) decided he would become a winemaker when he was nine years old, and duly obtained his wine science degree from the Adelaide University, working each vintage during his degree course at Haselgrove Wines and later Kay Bros. It is a long way from Hawkers Gate, which takes its name from the gate at the border of Australias dog fence between SA and NSW, 250km north of Broken Hill. A few rows of saperavi have been planted. Exports to the US.
