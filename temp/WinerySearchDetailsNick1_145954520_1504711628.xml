            The unusual name comes courtesy of the great-great-grandfather of Richard Knox, who is, with Geraldine Knox, the proprietor of the business. Byramgou was the name of the ship which his forebear sailed to Arabia in 1821; he received a gold cup, depicted on the label, for his deeds. These details to one side, the estate-grown wines are produced from chardonnay, grenache and shiraz.
