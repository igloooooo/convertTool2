            In 1997 Peter and Cath Mullany began to diversify the cherry and stone fruit orchard set up by Peters father in 1965 by establishing a vineyard on part of the land. They now have 2ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, and 1.5ha each of chardonnay and viognier. Selling all their grapes to larger wine companies up to 2005, they moved to have a Cabernet Sauvignon made, adding Chardonnay in 06, branching out to a Chardonnay Viognier and Shiraz in 07. At their first-ever entry into a wine show in 08, their 07 Patrick Shiraz won the top gold medal in its class at the Cowra Wine Show, a dream start. As well as visiting the cellar door, you can pick your own cherries, apricots, peaches, plums and strawberries in season.
