            Jylland is the Danish spelling for Jutland (the Jutland Peninsula divides the North Sea from the Baltic Sea and is home to mainland Denmark and the northern part of Germany). Co-owner Edel Grocke (with Terry Grocke) brought her Viking heritage with her to Australia, with a particular liking for sunshine, fine food and fresh, fruity wine. They have established a total of 4ha of vines, the lions share to chardonnay (1.5ha), the remainder spread across chenin blanc, verdelho, carnelian, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon.
