            The Howarth family progressively established the vineyard from 1987, and made its first commercial vintage in ’97. Acacia pycnantha is the botanical name for the golden wattle that grows wild over the hills of the Howarth farm, and they say it was ‘a natural choice to name our vineyards Pycnantha Hill’. I am not too sure that marketing gurus would agree, but there we go.
