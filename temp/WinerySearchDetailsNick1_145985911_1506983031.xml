            Howard and Elly Spark established their vineyard (shiraz, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, merlot and semillon) south of the burgeoning Southern Highlands region, falling in the Southern NSW Zone. It sits 700m above sea level on deep red soils with iron-rich sediments (doubtless causing the colour) and limestone. The limestone-clad cellar door overlooks Lake Sooley, 7 mins drive from Goulburn.
