            While the establishment date is shown as 2008, the Cranswick brand was created in 1991 when owner Graham Cranswick-Smith initiated a management buy-out of Diageos bulk winemaking facility in the Riverina. Since then it has diversified by also marketing its own broad range of wines (Cranswick Lakefield, Cranswick Estate and Cranswick Sarus) from cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, colombard and semillon. Exports to all major markets.
