            Notwithstanding the quite extensive winemaking experience (and formal training) of Graeme Jukes, this started life as small-scale winemaking in the raw version of the French garagiste approach. Graeme and his wife Sally-Ann now have 10ha of shiraz and 3ha cabernet sauvignon, with lesser amounts of chardonnay, merlot and a hatful of viognier. There are plans to plant a further 34ha of shiraz. After a fire in 2007 destroyed the winery and cellar door, the facility has been rebuilt, bigger and better than before. Exports to Canada, Germany, Denmark, Korea, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
