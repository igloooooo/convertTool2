            The MountTamborine name has caused no small degree of confusion over the years between several wineries in that region. This venture had its birthplace in the Tamborine region, but has now migrated to the Granite Belt, where its vineyard and winery are located. Here there is shiraz (7.6ha), cabernet sauvignon (3.6ha), chardonnay (3ha) and merlot (2.8ha).
