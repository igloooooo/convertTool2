            For over 40 years this family-owned vineyard and relatively low-profile winery has produced some outstanding wood-matured whites and pleasant, soft reds selling at attractive prices. The vineyards have roughly equal plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, mourvedre and chardonnay. It will be apparent from this that the essential part of the grape production is sold. Graham Phillips and Jan Curzon purchased Currency Creek Winery in 2009. Exports to the UK, the US and China.
