            A new $2.5 million commercial winery was opened in 2002, complementing the $1 million experimental winery opened in 01. The commercial winery was funded through the sale of wines produced under the CSU brand, which always offer exceptional value. Following the Universitys acquisition of the former University of Sydney campus in Orange (Leeds Parade, open Fri-Sun 114 or by appt), it now has 7.1ha of estate plantings at Wagga Wagga and 18ha of mature vineyards at Orange, the latter planted to chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Interestingly, this teaching facility is using screwcaps for all its wines, white and red, recalling its pioneering use in 1977. Moreover, since 2005 its sparkling wines have been released under crown seal.
