            Brian and Mandy Jean decided to establish a vineyard (and winery) in a region with similar growing conditions to the Rhne Valley, with 2.5ha of shiraz and 0.5ha each of viognier, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon. While they are technically in the Macedon Ranges region, the style of the wines is more typical of the cool end of Bendigo.The winery is cut into the side of a stony ridge, covered by an insulated curved steel roof spanning over 16m. Their property is roughly halfway between Castlemaine and Daylesford.
