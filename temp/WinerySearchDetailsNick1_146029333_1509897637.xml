            Gonz Terrel Jr and wife Lisa have taken over management of the business from father Gonzalo Terrel Sr, and have seen the business through a difficult period. It is primarily a bulk processing facility, with much of the wine sold in bulk to other winemakers. There are two own-label brands, Zalia and Terrel Estate, taking advantage of grape purchases from the Hunter Valley and various SA regions. Exports to most major markets.
