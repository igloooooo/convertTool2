            Terry and Jan Blundell commenced the planting of their vineyard in 1997 with chardonnay and pinot noir. In 2003 shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon were added, taking the total plantings to 2.5 ha. The cellar door, with views to the Baw Baw Ranges, is only 65 mins from the Melbourne CBD.
