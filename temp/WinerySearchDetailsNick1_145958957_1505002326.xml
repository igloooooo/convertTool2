            The Lorentz family,then headed by Gabi Lorentz,began the establishment of the Cherry Tree Hill vineyard in 2000 with the planting of 3ha each of cabernet sauvignon and riesling; 3ha each of merlot and sauvignon blanc followed in 01, and, finally, 2ha of chardonnay in 02. The inspiration was childhood trips on a horse and cart through his grandfathers vineyard in Hungary, and Gabis son (and current owner) David completes the three-generation involvement as manager of the business.
