            Gentle Annie was established by Melbourne businessman Tony Cotter; wife Anne and five daughters assist with sales and marketing. The name Gentle Annie refers to an early settler renowned for her beauty and gentle temperament. The vineyard includes 4ha of verdelho, 31ha of shiraz and 23ha of cabernet sauvignon planted on old volcanic ferrosol soils, similar to the red Cambrian loam at Heathcote. The winemaking team is headed by David Hodgson, who also heads up the Oenology faculty at Dookie College. The increasing production of Gentle Annie wines has a substantial export component.
