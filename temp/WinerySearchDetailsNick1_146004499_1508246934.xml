            This family-owned business is managed by Patrick Fowler, with support from mother Josephine and partner Annalisa Nardi. Patrick's love of Bendigo wines prompted a move from Melbourne in 2008. His role as viticulturist and winemaker came to fruition through studies at NMIT (Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE) as well as gaining valuable experience with Balgownie Estate.
