            Max Thalmann came from Switzerland in 1961, retiring 30 years later, and planted his 0.4ha vineyard entirely to gewurztraminer. As Tasmanian writer Phil Laing has pointed out, it is probably the only specialist gewurztraminer producer in the southern hemisphere. The label, incidentally, comes from a painting by Max Thalmann, which proves he is a man of many talents.
