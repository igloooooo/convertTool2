            The history of Billy Pye Vineyard is fascinating. It dates back to 1858, when William Grasby began establishing an apple orchard on a property near Balhannah on the upper reaches of the Onkaparinga River. The neighbouring property on the southern side had been owned since 1868 by colourful local character WH (Billy) Pye, a surveyor and engineer. His property contained the largest hill in the area, known locally as Billy Pye Hill, where he built his house. In 1997 Sandra Schubert, a fifth-generation Grasby, began to plant a vineyard on the northern slopes of Billy Pye Hill in partnership with John Bowley, leaving the top of the hill with the native vegetation Billy had loved. The wines currently available are made from grapes grown on a small site on the eastern slopes of the vineyard. The Glengyle Red is named after a variety of apple developed by the Grasby family.
