            Susan and Mark Francis Foster established Yarrawa Estate in 1998, planting a wide variety of trees, table grapes and 2.5ha of verdelho, chardonnay, chambourcin, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. The hillside vineyard has views across the Kangaroo Valley, with the Kangaroo River directly below. Finger board directions up the hill point the way for the first-time visitor. Has had good success at local wine shows.
