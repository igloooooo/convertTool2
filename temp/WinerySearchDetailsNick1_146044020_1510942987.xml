            Robert and Julie Yates have a long-established sheep and wheat property. Like so many others, they thought some diversification would be a good idea, and planted 5ha in 1996. In 1997 a bushfire devastated the vineyard, destroying virtually all the vines, the irrigation system and endposts. With the help of family and friends they started again, this time with 2500 vines each of chardonnay and shiraz. Life in the bush can be tough.
