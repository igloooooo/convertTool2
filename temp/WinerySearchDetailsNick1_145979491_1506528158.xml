            The Hirsch family has planted a vineyard to pinot noir (predominantly), cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, merlot and cabernet franc. (New plantings of 2.5ha of sauvignon blanc, shiraz and viognier were lost in the Black Saturday bushfires.) The vineyard is part of a larger racehorse stud, situated in a mini-valley at the northern end of the Yarra Valley.
