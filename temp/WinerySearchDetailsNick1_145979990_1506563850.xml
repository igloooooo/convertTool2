            In 2003 the former Wellington winery was acquired by Tony Scherer and Jack Kidwiler of Frogmore Creek and renamed Hood Wines. It will continue to operate as previously, making both its own label wines and wines for its other contract customers while a new winery is constructed on the Frogmore Creek property. The latter will be exclusively devoted to organically grown wines. Exports to the US, Trinidad/Tobago, Indonesia and Japan.
