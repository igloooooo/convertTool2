            Eddie Sawiris and partner Sharon Martin have a micro vineyard equally split between shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. It has immaculate address credentials: adjacent to Leeuwin Estate and Voyager Estate, 6km from the Margaret River township. The hand-tended vines are grown without the use of insecticides. Exports to France and Thailand.
