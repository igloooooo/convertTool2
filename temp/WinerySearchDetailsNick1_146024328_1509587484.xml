            The Mulligan family has lived in the Penola/Coonawarra region since 1909. In 1937 a 250ha property 15km west of Penola, including an 80ha ridge of terra rossa over limestone, was purchased for grazing. The ridge was cleared, the remainder of the property was untouched and is now a private wildlife sanctuary. In 1986 Barry and Glenys Mulligan planted shiraz and cabernet sauvignon on the ridge, followed by merlot in the early 90s. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
