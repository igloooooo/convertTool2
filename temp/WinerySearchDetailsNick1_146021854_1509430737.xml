            When Vaughn Dell and Linda Morice purchased the former Golders Vineyard from Richard Crabtree in 2005, they were only 24. Both were originally from Tasmania, but between 01 and 05 lived in various parts of Australia; Linda completed a university degree in occupational therapy and Vaughn worked at wineries in the Hunter Valley,Yarra Valley (at Wedgetail Estate) and Margaret River (Barwick Estates) before returning to Tasmania to undertake vintage at Tamar Ridge in 05. The vineyard had 1ha of mature pinot noir and 0.2ha of mature chardonnay. They have now also leased the Bellingham Vineyard, which has 1.2ha of riesling and 0.8ha of chardonnay. A small winery and cellar door opened in 2010.
