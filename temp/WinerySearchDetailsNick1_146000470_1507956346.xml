            When it was built in 1891 by English wine merchant Peter Burgoyne, Mount Ophir Estate was said to be the largest state-of-the-art winemaking facility in the world, and its brick buildings are as impressive today as they were 116 years ago. While the buildings have survived well, the 300ha vineyard had shrunk to a poorly-tended 4ha of shiraz when Ruth Hennessy acquired the property and began the refurbishment of the vineyards, discontinuing the use of chemical sprays, and having the Shiraz made with minimal preservatives to organic winemaking standards. The National Trust and Heritage Victoria listed buildings provide B&amp;B in the main homestead, with two self-contained farmhouses also available.
