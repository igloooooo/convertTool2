            The Macedon Ridge vineyard was established in 1984 on the northern slopes of Mt Macedon. Right from the outset the aim was to produce sparkling wines, and, with this in mind, 2ha of chardonnay and 1ha of pinot noir were established. Owners Geoff and Leesa Mackay are responsible for the meticulous management of the vines.
