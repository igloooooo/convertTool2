            Owned by Suzanne Rutschmann, who has a PhD in Chemistry, a Diploma in Horticulture and a BSc (Wine Science) from CSU, and Swiss-born Peter Albrecht, a civil and structural engineer who has also undertaken various courses in agriculture and viticulture. For a part-time occupation, these are exceptionally impressive credentials. Their vineyard (pinot noir, cabernet, shiraz, cabernet franc and merlot) was planted between 1991 and 98. Sarsfield Pinot Noir has enjoyed success in both domestic and international wine shows. No insecticides are used in the vineyard, the winery runs on solar and wind energy and relies entirely on rain water. Wines were received after the 2013 edition went to print.
