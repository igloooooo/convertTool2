            Naked Run Wines is the virtual winery of university graduates Jayme Wood, Bradley Currie and Steven Baraglia, their skills ranging from viticulture through to production, and also all-important sales and marketing. The riesling is sourced from Clare Valley, grenache from the Williamstown area of the Barossa Valley, and shiraz from Greenock.
