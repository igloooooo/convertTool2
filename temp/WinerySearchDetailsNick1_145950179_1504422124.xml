            Blackwood Crest has been holding a low profile while developing its vineyards (cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, riesling, semillon, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir and merlot) and a 100-tonne winery. It has been an ongoing project, and progresses as time allows, which is fitting, as Max Fairbrasss grandparents took up the property as virgin bush in 1908.
