            Rob Fairall and partner Luanne Hill have brought to fruition their vision to establish an Italian enoteca operation, offering Italian varietal wines and foods. When they began to plant their vineyard in 1998, the Italian varietal craze was yet to gain serious traction. They now have a thoroughly impressive range of barbera, sangiovese, vermentino, aleatico, lagrein, greco di tufo, picolit and nebbiolo. The estate also produces olives for olive oil and table olives, and the range of both wine and food will increase over the years. The decision to focus on Italian varieties has been a major success, the quality of the wines, however, the key to that success.
