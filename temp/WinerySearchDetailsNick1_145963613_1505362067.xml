            Part of the Katnook Estate, Riddoch and Deakin Estate triumvirate, which constitutes the Wingara Wine Group, now fully owned by Freixenet of Spain. Deakin Estate draws from its own vineyards, making it largely self-sufficient, and produces wines of consistent quality and impressive value, thanks in no small part to the skills and expertise of winemaker Phil Spillman. Exports to all major markets.
