            The change of address marks the fact that the Cruickshanks have purchased a substantial existing vineyard near Denman; the original vineyard is now a coal-mining site. The new vineyard is predominantly planted to cabernet sauvignon, verdelho, shiraz, chardonnay and cabernet franc. Exports to China.
