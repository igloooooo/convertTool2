            While the establishment date of Witchcliffe Estate is shown as 2003, 8ha of semillon, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay and shiraz plantings date back to the early 1990s. Tony and Maureen Cosby acquired the 69ha property in 2000, at which time it was best known as the Margaret River Marron Farm. The Cosbys still farm marron on a small scale, selling them at the farm gate and through the cellar door. It has been a very impressive start.
