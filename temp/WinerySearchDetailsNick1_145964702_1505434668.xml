            Michael and Wendy ODea founded the winery while they had parallel lives as public servants in Canberra, but they have now retired, and devote themselves full time to the winery. They purchased their property at Murrumbateman in 1996, and planted chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, riesling, viognier, merlot, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz between 1998 and 2001. Michael has completed an associate degree in winemaking at CSU, and is responsible for viticulture and winemaking; Wendy has completed various courses at the Canberra TAFE and is responsible for wine marketing and (in their words) nagging Michael and being a general slushie.
