            Clovely Estate has the largest vineyards in Qld, having established over 170ha of immaculately maintained vines at two locations just to the east of Murgon in the Burnett Valley. There are 120ha of red grapes (including 60ha of shiraz) and 54ha of white grapes. The attractively packaged wines are sold in six tiers: Double Pruned at the top; followed by Estate Reserve; Left Field, featuring alternative varieties and styles; then the White Label and Shed ranges for everyday drinking, distributed through the Qld retail market; and at the bottom, First Picked, primarily designed for the export market at low price points. The estate also has a second cellar door and B&amp;B at 210 Musgrave Road, Red Hill. Exports to Denmark, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan and China.
