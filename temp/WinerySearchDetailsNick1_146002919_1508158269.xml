            Nepenthe quickly established its reputation as a producer of high quality wines, but when founder Ed Tweddell died unexpectedly in 2006, the business was purchased by McGuigan Simeon the following year. The winery was closed in 09, and winemaking operations transferred to Australian Vintage, McGuigan Simeons principal SA winery. (The Nepenthe winery has since been purchased by Peter Leske and Mark Kozned, and provides contract winemaking services via their Revenir venture.) Nepenthe has over 100ha of close-planted vineyards spread over four vineyards in the Adelaide Hills, with an exotic array of varieties. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
