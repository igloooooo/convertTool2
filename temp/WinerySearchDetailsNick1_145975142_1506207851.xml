            Industry veteran Robert Constable, former director of Hungerford Hill, has established Greenbrier Park Vineyard at an altitude of 740m on north-facing basalt soils, with cool winds and low frost risk. The original plantings of 0.35ha of cabernet sauvignon, 0.48ha of sauvignon blanc and 0.21ha of pinot noir were extended with the planting of 0.35ha of pinot noir in 2005.
