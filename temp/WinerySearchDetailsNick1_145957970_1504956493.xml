            Charlies Estate is the new name and face for a long-established vineyard, gardens and winery site, originally Evans &amp; Tate Gnangara and thereafter Swanbrook Estate. It is the venture of Carmelo Salpietro, and offers wines at varying price levels: Charlies Origins at the entry point, the Today Range (from key WA regions), The Knotted Vine (limited release from select fruit parcels) and Charlies Origins Regional Selection Range (also limited release).
