            When Ross and Sarah Ferguson purchased what is now known as Lake Cairn Curran Vineyard in 1999, they acquired not only the vineyard (chardonnay, pinot noir and shiraz), but also a slice of history, evoked by the beautiful labels. The Park Hill homestead dates back to the establishment of the Tarrengower Run in the 1840s, and the mudbrick cellar door is located adjacent to the homestead, overlooking the Cairn Curran Reservoir and Loddon River Valley. Notwithstanding that, Sarah has a wine science (oenology) degree from CSU, and having worked several vintages at Moorooduc Estate, makes small batches of wine at the newly renovated onsite winery. However, Rick McIntyre will continue to make the major table wine releases, David Cowburn of Kilchurn the sparkling wines.
