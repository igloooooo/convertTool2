            The Oaks has been established in what was originally a Presbyterian manse, the change in use coming after a long period of neglect, and thus not incurring the wrath of the previous occupants. Owner Pauline Charlton spent 12 months restoring the Victorian homestead to its former glory prior to opening. A gallery features photographs by Pauline's daughter, Mackenzie, and fellow students of the Photography Studies College. The vineyard is close-planted, and the wine competently made.
