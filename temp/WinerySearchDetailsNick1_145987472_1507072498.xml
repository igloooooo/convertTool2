            Lynette Chester and Trevor Wallis have planted 2.5ha of shiraz, chenin blanc, taminga, grenache and barbera as well as an olive grove. The wines are made onsite, and the estate-made extra virgin olive oil is also available for tasting. The cellar door verandah overlooks the estate vineyard and Hartley Estate on the opposite slope, and then on to the Swan Valley National Park.
