            When Rod and Mim Smallman began the development of Chirping Bird in 1999, it was a foregone conclusion that shiraz would be the first variety to be planted. The decision to plant muscat (frontignac) came from left field; the original plan was to plant pinot gris, which was then gaining a lot of attention on the Peninsula. It was suggested that muscat gave the option of moscato, and also a fortified style. The fortified version was made in 2005, '06, '07 and '08, and a small make will continue for several years from '10 onwards before a solera is started. The chardonnay is contract-grown from a 1ha planting at Red Hill.
