            The Willsons have been grapegrowers in the Langhorne Creek region for some considerable time but their dual business as grapegrowers and winemakers has expanded significantly. Their vineyards have more than doubled (predominantly cabernet sauvignon and shiraz), as has their production of wine. In 2004 sisters Rebecca and Lucy (marketing) took control of the business, marking the event with (guess what) revamped label designs. Can fairly claim to be the best producer in Langhorne Creek. Exports to all major markets.
