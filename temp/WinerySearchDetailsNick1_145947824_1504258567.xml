            In 1999 partners Norman Seckold and Dudley Leitch realised a long-held ambition to establish a vineyard in the Hunter Valley with the acquisition of their 17-ha site. Plantings have steadily increased and are presently chardonnay (5.7 ha), shiraz (4.9 ha), merlot (2 ha), semillon (1.2 ha) and a carefully thought out marketing strategy has been put in place. Exports to Hong Kong and Singapore.
