            This is one of the larger vineyard developments in New England, established by Rajesh and Geeta Upadhyaya. They have planted chardonnay (10ha), shiraz (7ha), verdelho and tempranillo (4ha each). The grapes from the estate plantings are supplemented by pinot noir, semillon, sauvignon blanc, riesling, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, giving rise to 20 wines on the price list. Much of the wine is sold through a wine club.
