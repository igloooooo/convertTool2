            After holidaying in the area for 20 years, Neil and Telle Prestegar decided the time had come to take up permanent residence after Neil retired from his engineering company in 1998. Not wishing to do things by halves, they created a trout-filled dam, extensive gardens and a picturesque vineyard, with 2.5ha of sauvignon blanc, 1.5ha of pinot noir and 1ha of merlot. They purchase grapes from local growers to make their Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon (in addition to the estate-based varietals).
