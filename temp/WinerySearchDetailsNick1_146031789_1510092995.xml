            A very interesting operation run by former Seppelt sparkling winemaker Warren Randall, drawing upon estate vineyards, and specialising in bulk-wine sales to major Australian wine companies. A small proportion of the production is sold direct through the cellar door at mouthwateringly low prices to customers who provide their own containers and purchase by the litre. It has recently joined forces with James Haselgrove in the Blackbilly venture. Exports to the UK, France and Germany.
