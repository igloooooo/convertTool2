            Owners Desmond and Susan Young began making fruit wines when they moved to the UK in 1980 to work. Elderberry, and rosehip and fig, gave way to wine grape juice obtained from France. When they returned to Australia 24 years later, they decided they wanted to make red wine, and Susan wanted a place with enough rain to have a good garden. So they chose the Hunter Valley,but without realising how often the rain fell at the wrong time. This hasnt deterred them at all, and, moreover, Hunter semillon has entrenched itself. They have 5.4ha of vines at their home vineyard, and an additional 2.5ha of vines planted in approximately 1960 in the Belford area. The family unit is completed with an ethnic restaurant in the Hunter known as Mariachis, owned and run by their daughter.
