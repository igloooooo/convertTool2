            Allan Bagley and wife Janneke have planted a substantial 18.57ha vineyard with shiraz, verdelho, sangiovese, chambourcin, semillon and chardonnay. Until 2004 most of the grapes were sold to others, but since then all of the production has gone to the Benwarin label. The yield is restricted to 2 tonnes per acre, and the wines have been consistent medal winners. Exports to Canada.
