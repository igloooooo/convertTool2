            This small winery is owned and run by the Cuthbertson family, established by Alan and Jan as a minor diversification from their cattle property.

Son Hugh, himself with a long and high-profile wine career, has overseen the marketing of the wines, including the Family Reserve and Dont Tell Dad brands. Exports to the UK, the US, Finland, Estonia and China.
