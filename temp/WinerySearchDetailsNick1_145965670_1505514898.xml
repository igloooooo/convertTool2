            Following the acquisition of Doonkuna by Barry and Maureen Moran in late 1996, the plantings were increased to almost 20 ha, and include shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, zinfandel, sangiovese, riesling, merlot and pinot noir. A wide range of vintages of many of the wines is available at cellar door at modest prices.
