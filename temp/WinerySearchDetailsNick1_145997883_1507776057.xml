            Mitolo has had a meteoric rise since Frank Mitolo decided to turn a winemaking hobby into a business. In 2000 he took the plunge into the commercial end of the business, inviting Ben Glaetzer to make the wines. Split between the Jester range and single vineyard wines, Mitolo began life as a red wine-dominant brand, but now also produces Rose and Vermentino. Exports to all major markets.
