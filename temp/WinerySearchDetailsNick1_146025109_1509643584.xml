            The John family is one of the best known in the Barossa Valley, with branches running Australias best cooperage (AP John &amp; Sons) and providing the former chief winemaker of Lindemans (Philip John) and the former chief winemaker of Quelltaler (Stephen John). Stephen and Rita John have now formed their own family business in the Clare Valley, based on a vineyard (riesling and shiraz) overlooking Watervale, and supplemented by grapes from local growers. The cellar door is a renovated 80-year-old stable full of rustic charm. Exports to Canada, Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives and Singapore.
