            This is the venture of Geoff and Joan Anson, and Ken King (who also owns Kings of Kangaroo Ground and manages the Eltham post office from his winery). The partners have established 3.6ha of pinot noir, shiraz, chardonnay, marsanne and cabernet sauvignon on the northern side of a ridge above the Barwon River, overlooking the You Yangs and ultimately the plains towards Port Phillip. Drought conditions since 1999, and limited access to water, has meant that many vines had to be replaced, and the vineyard has grown slowly. In the meantime limited quantities of grapes sourced from Geelong vineyards are being purchased, and the wines made at the Kangaroo Ground winery by the partners.
