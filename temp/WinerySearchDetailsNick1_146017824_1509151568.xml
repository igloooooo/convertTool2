            Say the owners Saint &amp; Sinner wines is the lovechild of husband and wife team; viticulturist Luke Edwards and marketer Renee de Saxe. They spent many years in various wine businesses prior to purchasing their vineyard in 2005, and in 06 made 2 tonnes of 60-year-old estate-grown shiraz in a micro-winery. The wines now extend far beyond Lake Wyangan (in the Riverina),with a Tasmanian sparkling wine,Adelaide Hills Pinot Gris, McLaren Vale Syrah and Wrattonbully Cabernet Sauvignon. The marketing imprint of Renee is evident everywhere; as a female she has no difficulty playing the sexy/sexist female card, although I have to confess to an acute aversion to the Savvy Blanc labels soubriquet. Exports to the UK and the US.
