            Donald and Sally Willson began planting their vineyard in 1991, having purchased the property in 83. In 2004 daughter Hannah Rantanen took over day-to-day management. Subsequently, the estate vineyard has been trimmed to 5ha of cabernet sauvignon, and wine production reduced. On the other side of the equation, shiraz and malbec are purchased from Clare Valley growers. Exports to Canada, Denmark and Indonesia.
