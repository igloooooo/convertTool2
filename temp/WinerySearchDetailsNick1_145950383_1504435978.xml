            Rhonda and Stephen Doyle are two of the pioneers of the Orange district. The estate vineyards (chardonnay, riesling, merlot, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, cabernet franc and malbec) are planted at an elevation of 810860m, which provides a reliably cool climate; frost can be an issue, but heat seldom is. The wines are sold mainly through the cellar door and by an energetic, humorous and informatively run mailing list (see, for example, the tasting note for Big Men in Tights). Has an impressive track record across the full gamut of varietal (and other) wine styles, especially Riesling, in a variety of styles; all of the wines have a particular elegance and grace. Very much part of the high quality reputation of Orange.
