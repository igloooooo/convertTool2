            The intriguingly named Farmers Daughter Wines is a family-owned vineyard, named for the daughters of Lance and Gwen Smith, who originally planted grapes for sale, looking to retirement. Retirement, they say, has now become a 10-day week. Part of the production from the vineyard, planted to shiraz (8ha), cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay (3.2ha each), is sold to other makers, but the majority is made for the Farmers Daughter label. Exports to the US, Canada and Vietnam.
