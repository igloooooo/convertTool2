            The Kies family has been resident in the Barossa Valley since 1857; the present generation of winemakers is the fifth. Until 1969 the family sold almost all their grapes, but in that year they launched their own brand, Karrawirra. The coexistence of Killawarra forced a name change in 1983 to Redgum Vineyard; this business was subsequently sold. Later still, Kies Family Wines opened for business, drawing upon vineyards (up to 100 years old) that had remained in the family throughout the changes, offering a wide range of wines through the 1880 cellar door. Exports to the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
