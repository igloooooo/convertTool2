            Owners John Trueman (viticulturist) and wife Julie (winemaker) began the planting of Myrtaceae in 1985, intending to make a Bordeaux-style red blend. It became evident that these late-ripening varieties were not well suited to the site, so the vineyard was converted to chardonnay (0.6ha) and pinot noir (0.4ha) in 1998. Part of the property is devoted to the Land for Wildlife Scheme; the integrated Australian garden is a particular feature.
