            The estate plantings are some of the oldest in Tasmania, led by cabernet sauvignon (1.5ha) and pinot noir (1.25ha), but also with chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and shiraz. The Lithgow Gallery has installed its large collection of traditional and contemporary Australian paintings and etchings at the fully restored Federation house at Elmslie.
