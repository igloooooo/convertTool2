            A historic winery and adjacent house are superb legacies of the 19th century. Progressive modernisation of the winemaking facilities and operations has seen the quality of the white wines improve significantly; the red wines now receive a percentage of new oak. Another recent innovation has been the introduction of the Gourmet Courtyard, which serves lunch on weekends, public holidays and Vic school holidays.
