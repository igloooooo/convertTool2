            The property that Robert Holloway and family purchased in 1993 on which the vineyard is now established was an operating dairy farm. In 1997, 5.5ha of shiraz was planted. Over the following years 3.8ha of merlot and then (in 2004) 5.3ha of chardonnay and 2ha of sauvignon blanc were added. The Holloways see themselves as grapegrowers first and foremost, but make a small amount of wine under the Broomstick Estate label. The name of the business derives from the vineyards proximity to the town of Witchcliffe, or Witchy as the locals call it. The label design reflects the association of witches with broomsticks and ravens.
