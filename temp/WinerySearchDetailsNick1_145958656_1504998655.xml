            Jim Chatto spent several years in Tasmania as the first winemaker at Rosevears Estate. He has since moved to the Hunter Valley but has used his Tasmanian contacts to buy small parcels of riesling and pinot noir. Possessed of a particularly good palate, he has made wines of excellent quality under the Chatto label. A star Len Evans Tutorial scholar and an up-and-coming wine show judge, he is chief winemaker for Pepper Tree Estate.  Exports to the US and Canada.
