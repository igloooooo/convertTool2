            Edwards Wines is a family-owned and operated winery. Brothers Michael (formerly a winemaker at Voyager Estate) and Christo are the winemaker and viticulturist, respectively. The vineyard includes cabernet sauvignon (7.8ha), shiraz (5.2ha), sauvignon blanc (4.6ha), chardonnay (3.5ha), semillon (2.7ha) and merlot (1ha). The consistency in the quality of the wines is admirable. Exports to all major markets.
