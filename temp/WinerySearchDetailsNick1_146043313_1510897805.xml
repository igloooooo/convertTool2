            This is the oldest winery and vineyard in the Upper Hunter, established in 1958 as Penfolds Wybong Estate. It was acquired by Rosemount in 1974, and retained until 94. Between 1999 and 01 a new winery and storage area was built; after hitting financial turbulence it was acquired by a small group of Sydney businessmen. Board changes and subsequent strengthening of the management and winemaking team have seen export markets established in  the US, the UK and other major markets.
