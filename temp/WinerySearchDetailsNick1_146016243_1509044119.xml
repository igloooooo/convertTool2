            An amazing historic relic, seemingly untouched since its 19th-century heyday, producing conventional table wines but still providing some extraordinary fortifieds, including a truly stylish Madeira made from Riesling and Syrian (the latter variety originating in Persia). David and Joy Wall have now been joined by son Richard in the business, which will hopefully ensure continuity for this important part of Australian wine history. The vineyard has been increased with the planting of 0.5ha of the Italian grape garganega.
