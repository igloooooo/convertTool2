            Robert and Leanne Black purchased their 8ha property in 1997, part of a larger block that in the latter part of the 19th century was home to the then-renowned 14ha Hercynia Vineyard. After a trial planting of 100 shiraz cuttings in 1998, they completed planting of their vineyard in the spring of 99. Future plantings of cabernet sauvignon and possibly riesling or verdelho will depend on water availability.
