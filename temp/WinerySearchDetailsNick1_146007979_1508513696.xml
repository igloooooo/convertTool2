            Peter Treloar acquired Penna Lane Wines from its founders, the Klavins and Stafford-Brookes families, in 2009. Peter is no stranger to wine, having established Heritage Wines in 1984 in partnership with Steve Hoff. His return to the Clare Valley was preceded by his ancestor Francis Treloar, who in 1870 established a vineyard and winery that became known as Springvale. Peter has no intention of making major changes, and is keen to produce Riesling that reflects the distinct subregions within the Clare Valley, sourcing additional parcels of grapes from the Skilly Valley and Watervale.  Exports to Hong Kong, Korea, Fiji, Vietnam, Thailand, China and Japan.
