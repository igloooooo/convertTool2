            John Wade is arguably the most experienced winemaker in WA, with over 20 years' experience following his role as chief winemaker at Wynns Coonawarra Estate. He is best known for his involvement with Plantagenet and then Howard Park. Having sold his interest in Howard Park, he has become a consultant winemaker to a substantial number of producers; his own label is a relatively small part of his total wine business. The wines are chiefly sold through premium retail outlets and restaurants.
