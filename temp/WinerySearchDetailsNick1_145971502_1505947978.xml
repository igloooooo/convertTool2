            Barnaby Flanders was a co-founder of Allies Wines (see separate entry) in 2003, with some of the wines made under the Garagiste label. Allies has now gone its own way, and Barnaby has a controlling interest in the Garagiste brand. The future will focus on the Mornington Peninsula, and in particular grapes from Tuerong and Moorooduc in the north, with sand-based soils, the brown loam/red volcanic soils of Merricks and Merricks North in the middle, and the red volcanic soils of Red Hill and Main Ridge in the most elevated southern sector. Pinot noir and chardonnay will be the varieties used, and the wines will be made with wild yeasts, minimal handling and bottling without fining or filtration.
