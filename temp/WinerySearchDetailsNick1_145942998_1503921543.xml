            Ansted &amp; Co. was started as a busmans holiday by Tobias Ansted  then and now winemaker at Balgownie Estate  in 2003. Pressure of work and family commitments led to the sale of the vineyard in 2006, but with an agreement to buy back the grapes, and to manage the vineyard. While syrah was the initial planting, marsanne, roussanne and viognier will follow.
