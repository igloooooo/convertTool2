            This is a virtual winery created by the husband and wife team of Adam and Brooke Lampit. With almost two decades of industry experience between them, they began purchasing sauvignon blanc, shiraz and pinot noir (for sparkling) in 2008, having the wine made by Sam Scott. Adams experience came through working with Stonehaven, Norfolk Rise and Bird in Hand, while Brooke also worked at Norfolk Rise before moving to work for Wine Australia.
