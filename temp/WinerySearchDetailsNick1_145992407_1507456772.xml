            Madew Wines bowed to the urban pressure of Queanbeyan and purchased the Westering Vineyard from Captain GP Hood some years ago. Plantings there have now increased to 9.5 ha, with 1 ha each of shiraz and pinot gris coming into bearing. Madew's award-winning restaurant, grapefoodwine, is open Fri-Sat for lunch and dinner, Sun for breakfast and lunch, and also hosts monthly music concerts.
