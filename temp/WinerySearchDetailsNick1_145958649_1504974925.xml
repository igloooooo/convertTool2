            The Martin family, headed by Fernando and Jeanette, purchased the old Dorrien winery from the Seppelt family in 1984; in 90 the family purchased Twin Valley Estate and moved the winemaking operations of Chateau Dorrien to the Twin Valley site. All the Chateau Dorrien group wines are sold at Chateau Dorrien; Twin Valley is simply a production facility. In 2006 the family purchased a 32ha property at Myponga, with mature vineyards that now provide the grapes for San Fernando Estate, the new name of the vineyard.
