            Owner/operators Peter Butcher and Lizzie Tasker produce small quantities of hand-made, vineyard-specific wines from their estate vineyard (4ha of shiraz) and from other growers who share their views on quality and sustainability. A minimalist approach is taken in the winery with small open fermenters, gentle handling and maturation in older French oak barrels. Says Peter,We seek to make wines which reflect their sense of place and the seasons in which they are grown. Exports to the US, Sweden, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.
