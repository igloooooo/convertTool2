            This is the venture of two local Clare families, Rob and Mandy Knight, and Peter and Robyn Shearer. Together they own two vineyards, one to the north, and the other to the south of Clare. The vineyards were first planted in 1974, and are dry-grown and hand-pruned. In all there is shiraz, riesling, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Until 2009 much of the riesling and shiraz was sold to Leasingham Wines, but since 06 Wykari has steadily increased its production from 600 dozen, in partnership with Neil Paulett. Excess grapes continue to be sold.
