            William (Bill) Downie spends six months each year making wine in Burgundy, the other six based in the Yarra Valley with De Bortoli. He uses purchased grapes from older vines to make his own wines, avoiding the use of pumps, filtration and fining. The striking label, designed by artist Reg Mombassa, has helped obtain listings at The Prince Wine Store and elsewhere. In the Gourmet Traveller Winemaker of the Year Awards 06, Bill was awarded the Kemenys Medal for the Best Young Winemaker. His boss at De Bortoli, Stephen Webber, goes a little further when he says,Downie is the best winemaker in Australia. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year.
