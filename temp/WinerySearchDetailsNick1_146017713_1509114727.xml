            Douglas Gordan and wife Lillian purchased Rubicon in 2004, intending to expand their cattle enterprise. The property included a 6ha vineyard planted in 1992 to chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon by the original owners. When the sale of the grapes fell through, Douglas Gordan decided to have the wines made. Douglas is studying viticulture/wine production at Swinburne TAFE, and manages the vineyard using minimal intervention techniques with the help of his family.
