            Owner Ken Murchison selected his Macedon vineyard after studying viticulture at CSU and being strongly influenced by Dr Andrew Piries doctoral thesis. All the wines show distinct cool climate characteristics, the Quarry Red having clear similarities to the wines of Chinon in the Loire Valley. However, Portree has done best with Chardonnay, its principal wine (in terms of volume). Exports to China and Vanuatu.
