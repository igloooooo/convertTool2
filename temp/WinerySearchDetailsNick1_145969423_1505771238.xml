            After 15 years in the Hunter Valley with James Estate, Peter Orr (and wife Karen) moved to the Granite Belt and purchased Felsburg in 2008. It has a spectacular site, high on a rocky slope, with the winery itself built on a single huge boulder. It had been offering wine for sale via the cellar door (and mailing list) made by former master brewer Otto Haag for many years. The Orrs have expanded the activities at the cellar door and restaurant with themed functions and 'Weekends of Wine' where participants are introduced to grape growing and winemaking via lectures and practical demonstrations.
