            The husband-and-wife team of Gregory Burk Salter and Jane Vivienne Salter is the third generation of the Salter family to grow grapes at their Blanchetown property. They have a little over 20ha of chardonnay, semillon, colombard, ruby cabernet, shiraz, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and muscat gordo blanco; 450 tonnes are sold each year, the remaining 50 tonnes contract-made at various small Barossa Valley wineries. The cellar door and a self-contained B&amp;B adjoin the vineyard, which has Murray River frontage.
