            Battle of Bosworth is owned and run by Joch Bosworth (viticulture and winemaking) and partner Louise Hemsley-Smith (sales and marketing). The wines take their name from the battle which ended the War of the Roses, fought on Bosworth Field, Leicestershire in 1485. The vineyards were established in the early 1970s by parents Peter and Anthea Bosworth, in the foothills of the Mt Lofty Ranges in McLaren Vale. Conversion to organic viticulture began in 1995, with vines now 20 years and older, fully certified A-grade organic by ACO. The label depicts the yellow soursob (Oxalis pes-caprae), hated by gardeners everywhere, but whose growth habits make it an ideal weapon for battling weeds in organic viticulture. Shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay account for 75% of the plantings, with 10 more varieties making up the numbers. The Spring Seeds Wine Co. wines are made from estate vineyards. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Singapore.
