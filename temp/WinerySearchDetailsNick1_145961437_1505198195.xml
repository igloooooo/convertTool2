            Cooralook is part of the Yabby Lake stable, its future role still to be determined in the wake of the sale of its vineyards (the former Mt Helen) to Elgo Estate. The suggestion is the brand will be repositioned once the future grape resources are determined. Exports to the US, the UK, Canada, Sweden, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
