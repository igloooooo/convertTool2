            David and Margaret Blesing have slightly more than 11.5ha of vineyards, with shiraz (8.35ha) and cabernet sauvignon (2.35ha) dominant. The remainder is planted to merlot, nebbiolo, riesling, semillon and chardonnay. All but 5 tonnes of the shiraz is sold to Peter Lehmann Wines, its quality attracting a substantial bonus payment on top of the base contract price. A cellar door opened in 2008, adding to the range of cellar doors now available to visitors to the beautiful Southern Flinders Ranges.
