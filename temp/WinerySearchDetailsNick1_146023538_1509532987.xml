            Owner and winemaker Jock Gordon Jrs family have been grapegrowers for three generations, but in 1999 Jock took the plunge into commercial winemaking after a successful career as an amateur winemaker. He has 8ha of shiraz, 1ha of alicante bouschet and 1ha split between mourvedre and durif, supplemented by grapes from local growers. The Spook Hill vineyard is situated in the Cadell Valley,a former oxbow of the Murray River now bypassed by the river channel; silt soil deposited in the ancient river valley is especially suited to viticulture. All of the wines are open-fermented, basket-pressed and matured in the onsite winery.
