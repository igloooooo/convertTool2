            Peter Douglas made a name for himself while working as a senior winemaker with Wynns Coonawarra Estate in the 1980s. For various reasons, he and his medical practitioner wife headed overseas, briefly in the US, and thereafter Sicily. The wheel has now turned full circle with the Douglases once again living in Coonawarra, Peter both making wine under his own label, and running an extensive winemaking consultancy business. He makes two Cabernets: Chime Hoop, matured in American oak, and designed for early drinking; and Bulge Hoop, matured in French oak, with greater depth and richness, and a longer life.
