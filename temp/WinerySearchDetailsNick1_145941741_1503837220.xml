            The Porter family planted 10ha of semillon, sauvignon blanc, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon with the sole intention of selling the grapes to other winemakers in the region. However, as has been the case with hundreds of other such ventures, the family has decided to have some of the production vinified under the Allison Valley label. Exports to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.
