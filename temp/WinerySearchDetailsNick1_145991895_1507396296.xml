            Jointly owned by Rod James and Tony Maxwell, Louee is a substantial operation. Its home vineyard is at Rylstone with 10 ha, led by shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and merlot, with chardonnay, cabernet franc, verdelho and viognier making up the balance. The second vineyard is on Nullo Mountain, bordered by the Wollemi National Park, at an altitude of 1100 m, high by any standards. Here 4.45 ha of cool-climate varieties (riesling, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, pinot gris and nebbiolo) have been planted.
