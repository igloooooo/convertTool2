            The unusual name comes from a bend in the Murray River considered by riverboat owners of the 19th century to resemble Cape Horn, which is depicted on the wine label. The property was acquired by Echuca GP Dr Sue Harrison and her schoolteacher husband Ian in 1993. Ian has progressively planted their vineyard to chardonnay (3ha), shiraz, cabernet sauvignon (2ha each), durif, marsanne (1.5ha each) and zinfandel (1ha).
