            The Birthday Villa name comes from the 19th-century Birthday Mine at nearby Drummond discovered on Queen Victorias birthday. Gewurztraminer (1.5ha) was planted in 1962; cabernet sauvignon (0.5ha) followed later. The quality of the Gewurztraminer comes as no surprise, as the very cool climate is suited to the variety. On the other hand, the Cabernet Sauvignon comes as a major surprise, although there are likely to be vintages where the variety will provide a major challenge as it struggles for ripeness.
