            Steve Skidmore and Deidre Broad created the Mollys Cradle brand concept in 1997, moving to reality with the first planting of estate vines in 2000, the first vintage following in 02. They have 2ha each of verdelho, chardonnay, merlot and shiraz, plus 1ha of petit verdot, but also look to other regions to supplement the estate-grown grapes. Thus, for the time being, shiraz comes from Wrattonbully, merlot from Mudgee and sauvignon blanc (for blending with Hunter semillon) from Orange. A significant part of the business is the luxury Cradle Lodge, built as a 5-star adult retreat comfortably accommodating up to three couples. A new cellar door was opened in Nov '09 (the only cellar door I can remember being opened ahead of schedule) with a variety of attractions. Exports to Indonesia and Malaysia.
