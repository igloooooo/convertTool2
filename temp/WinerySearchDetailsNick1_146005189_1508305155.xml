            It is ironic that record rainfall and floods should have led to the decision by the Widdop family to diversify from the lucerne crop which was totally destroyed by the floods. Initially vines and lucerne grew side by side until the lucerne was replaced by cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and touriga nacional. Until 2004 the grapes were sold, but in that year a Cabernet Sauvignon was made, followed by the '05 Rose made from touriga nacional. The retention of John Glaetzer as winemaker in 2006 has seen a move to improving fruit quality with biodynamic principles, and plans for an onsite winery in the old chaff mill sheds. Exports to the UK and China.
