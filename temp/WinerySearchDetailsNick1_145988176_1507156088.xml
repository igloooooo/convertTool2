            Lankeys Creek was established in 2005 when it leased the vineyard previously operated by the Upper Murray Estate. Estate plantings are 3ha each of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, plus 2ha of chardonnay and 1ha of riesling, with contract-grown grapes also sourced from Tumbarumba. The white wines are made in Flexitank plastic bags, which winemaker Steve Thompson believes prevent oxidation and enhance flavour components, particularly with small batches.
