            The Hunter family  parents Linda and Tony at the head, and their children Mark and Jodi, with their respective partners Melissa and Brett  began establishing the vineyard in 1997. It has grown to 20.16ha of shiraz, with smaller plantings of chardonnay, viognier, merlot, tempranillo, petit verdot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. Low-yielding vines and the magic of the Heathcote region have produced Shiraz of exceptional intensity, which has received rave reviews in the US, and led to the sold out sign being posted almost immediately upon release. With the ever-expanding vineyard, Mark has become full time vigneron and Jodi full time General Manager. Exports to China.
