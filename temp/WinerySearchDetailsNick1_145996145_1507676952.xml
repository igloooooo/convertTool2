            Merum Estate stirred from slumber after morphing from grower and winemaker to pure grapegrowing after the 2006 vintage. Mike Melsom is the link with the past, for it was he and partner Julie Roberts who were responsible for the extremely good wines made in 05 and 06. The wines are released at three levels: the entry point Curious Nature, then the Signature range, and finally the Estate Premium Reserve range.
