            Antipodean Vintners started in 2008 as a venture between five friends  Mark and Simone Perks, Jamie Craig, Sarah Matthews and Angelo Tsirbas  all self-confessed wine enthusiasts. Their goal is to produce small batches of wine that best represent the location and vintage from where the grapes are sourced. They buy the grapes for their wine from 95-year-old vines in McLaren Vale. The first release from 2008 was an outstanding wine.
