            Brian Barry is an industry veteran with a wealth of winemaking and show judging experience. His is a vineyard-only operation (16ha of riesling, 4ha of cabernet sauvignon, 2ha of shiraz, and lesser amounts of merlot and cabernet franc), with a significant part of the output sold as grapes to other wineries. The wines are made under contract at various wineries under Brians supervision. As one would expect, the quality is reliably good. Exports to the UK and the US.
