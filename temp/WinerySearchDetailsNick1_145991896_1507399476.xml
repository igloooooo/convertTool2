            Louis de Castella has an immaculate wine pedigree, his grandfather and great-grandfather were Francois and Hubert de Castella respectively. He returned to Vic in 2000 after a prolonged absence, and began working in vineyards and wineries on the Mornington Peninsula before he and partner Elizabeth Murphy decided to set up their own winemaking venture. After four years searching for the right site they came across a small vineyard in the heart of Heathcote. It was a 30-year-old block of shiraz that had suffered years of neglect, so they set about reconstituting it using biodynamic methods. Drought, frost, heatwaves and floods made the journey a slow one, but in 07 they made their first wine, and in 08 opened the rendered straw-bale cellar door. They make organic, biodynamic and conventional wines in the small, onsite winery.
