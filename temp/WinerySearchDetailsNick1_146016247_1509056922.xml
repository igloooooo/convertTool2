            Mike and Sally Calneggia have been at the forefront of vineyard development in the Margaret River over the past decade, but also have various winemaking interests. The original Rosabrook Estate vineyards were established progressively between 1984 and 96. In 2007 Rosabrook relocated its estate vineyard to the northwestern end of the Margaret River wine region, overlooking Geographe Bay and the Indian Ocean. The warm days and cool nights, influenced by the ocean, result in slow, mild-ripening conditions. The cellar door is housed in what was Margaret Rivers first commercial abattoir, built in the early 1930s, hence the icon red is named Slaughterhouse Block. Exports to Dubai, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
