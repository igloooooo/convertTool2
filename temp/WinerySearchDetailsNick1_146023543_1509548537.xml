            Roger Williams (who has lived on Kangaroo Island all his life) and wife Kate planted the first vines on their property in 1995, and after some trial and error, have now settled on shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. They personally do all the work in the vineyard, including pruning, spraying and  of course  picking. They also have an al fresco caf/restaurant in Kingscote (Rogers Cafe), which seats 60 and is the cellar door sales outlet for the wines. The quality of the wines is impressive.
