            The next generation of the Robb family (Emily, Huw and Sasha) of Sally's Paddock have established their own vineyard, with 8ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon and 2ha each of cabernet franc and merlot. Hundred Tree Hill was so named to commemorate the 100 trees that went into the building of the Hundred Tree Homestead. Exports to the US, Germany, China and Japan.
