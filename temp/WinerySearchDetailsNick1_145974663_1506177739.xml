            Under the eagle eye of Merilyn Hutton, Gralyn Estate has established a high reputation for its wines. The primary focus is on the full-bodied red wines, which are made in a distinctively different style from most from Margaret River, with an opulence reminiscent of some of the bigger wines from McLaren Vale. The age of the vines (35+ years) and the site are significant factors. Lesser amounts of chardonnay and fortified wines are also made.
