            Under the energetic and highly successful ownership of the founding Oatley family, Rosemount Estate was one of the brightest stars in the Australian wine sky. It merged with Southcorp in 2001, and what seemed to be a powerful and synergistic merger turned out to be little short of a disaster. It is now part of Fosterâ€™s, and ongoing efforts are being made to re-establish the brand value the business once had. The bleak economic outlook for the world, and continuing wine surpluses in Australia, seem likely to make the process slow. Exports to all major markets.
