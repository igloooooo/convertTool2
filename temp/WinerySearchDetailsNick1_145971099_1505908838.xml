            Sarah Squire (ne Fowler) has decided to do her own thing, with full support from father Ralph (see separate entry for Ralph Fowler Wines) and runs Frog Island with her viticulturist husband Nigel. The quixotic name is taken from a small locality inland from the seaside town of Robe, and the wine is deliberately made in a fresh, fruit-forward style. With no other employees every aspect of the business has a personal touch and down to earth approach. The cellar door opened in 2010. Exports to The Netherlands.
