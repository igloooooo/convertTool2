            Hamiltons Bluff is owned and operated by the Andrews family, which established 44ha of vines at their Canowindra vineyard, the largest planting that of chardonnay, but with significant quantities of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, followed by sangiovese and semillon. More recently they embarked on a 2.4ha vineyard at Orange, with 0.4ha each of chardonnay, riesling, viognier, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot.
