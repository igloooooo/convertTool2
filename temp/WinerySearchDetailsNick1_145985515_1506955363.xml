            In June 2008, the winery established by the late Dr Barry Killerby in 1973 was purchased by the Ferngrove wine group, and the estate vineyard was acquired by Sandalford. In 2012 a 13ha vineyard on Caves Road was leased, planted to chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon, blanc, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, supplementing the 3ha of estate cabernet sauvignon. The wines are made at Ferngrove; a new cellar door is planned.
