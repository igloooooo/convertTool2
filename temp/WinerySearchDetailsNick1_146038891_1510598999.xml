            Phil and Robin Dolan have established White Rock Vineyard in the northwest region of Tasmania, which, while having 13 wineries and vineyards, is one of the least-known parts of the island. Kimberley is 25km south of Devonport in the sheltered valley of the Mersey River. The Dolans have planted 2.4ha of pinot noir, chardonnay, riesling and pinot gris, the lions share going to the first two varieties. It has been a low-profile operation not only because of its location, but because most of the grapes are sold, with only Riesling, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay being made and sold through local restaurants and the cellar door at Lake Barrington Estate.
