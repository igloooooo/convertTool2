            Swallows Welcome is Margaret Rivers smallest winery, located in a mudbrick chapel and owned by Tim and Patricia Negus. He is winemaker and vineyard worker, while Patricia is a well-known watercolour artist and book illustrator. The estate plantings of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot were established between 1994 and 96; until 2003 the grapes were sold, but in that year the purchase contract ended, and Tims winemaking career commenced. The area under vine has also decreased from 3 to just under 2 ha, making the business more manageable.
