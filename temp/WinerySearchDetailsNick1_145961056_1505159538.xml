            Peter Easterbrook has a 25-year career as a professional grapegrower in McLaren Vale, and over an extended period has (with wife Jennie) planted 20ha of shiraz, 4ha of cabernet sauvignon and 2ha each of grenache and merlot. The estate is run using non-chemical regimes, relying on composting and natural fertilisers. Most of the grapes are sold, a small amount retained and made for export to Canada and Asia.
