            Temple Bruer was in the vanguard of the organic movement in Australia and was the focal point for the formation of Organic Vignerons Australia. Part of the production from its estate vineyards is used for its own label, part sold. Winemaker-owner David Bruer also has a vine propagation nursery, likewise run on an organic basis. Exports to the US and Japan.
