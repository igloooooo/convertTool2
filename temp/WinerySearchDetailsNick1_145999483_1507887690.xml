            In 1994, Glyn and Elizabeth Jamieson bought their small property on Mosquito Hill Road at Mt Jagged on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Glyn is yet another of the innumerable tribe of doctors who combine two professions; he just happens to be the prestigious Dorothy Mortlock Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery of the University of Adelaide. He and wife Elizabeths interest in wine goes back for decades, and in 1990 they lived in France for a year, where he received both vinous and medical recognition. In 1994 Glyn commenced the part-time (distance) degree at CSU and says that while he never failed an exam, it did take him 11 years to complete the course. His year in France directed him to Burgundy, rather than Bordeaux, hence the planting of chardonnay, pinot blanc and savagnin on the slopes of Mt Jagged on the Magpies Song Vineyard and pinot noir (clones 114 and MV6) on the Hawthorns Vineyard. Exports to the US,   China and Hong Kong.
