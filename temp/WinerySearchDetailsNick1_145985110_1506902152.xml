            Michael Katoa was introduced to wine at a young age at the behest of his mother, with tastings of up and coming producers in NZs rapidly developing wine industry. A move to Australia led to work in bars and restaurants, then as a wine retailer. Next came experience working in vineyards and wineries around the Mornington Peninsula, and thereafter Heathcote, with overlapping studies in wine science and viticulture at CSU. He and wife Natasha intend to make Heathcote their permanent home, and ultimately establish a vineyard and winemaking facility of their own. In the meantime, they are purchasing small amounts of shiraz and viognier from local growers, with sangiovese (Natasha has Italian heritage) also in the mix.
