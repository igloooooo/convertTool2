            Michael and Annabelle Waugh are disciples of Rocky OCallaghan of Rockford Wines, and have deliberately accumulated a series of old dryland, low-yielding Barossa vineyards, aiming to produce wines of unusual depth of flavour and character. They have succeeded handsomely in this aim, achieving icon status and stratospheric prices in the US, making the opinions of Australian scribes irrelevant. They also offer superior accommodation in Miriams, the ancient but beautifully restored two-bedroom cottage (Michael Waugh is also a skilled stonemason). Falls victim to 'no samples, no rating' rule, though quality is doubtless very good. Exports to the UK, Canada, France, Switzerland, Russia and Asia.
