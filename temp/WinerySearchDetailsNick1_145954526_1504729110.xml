            In November 2009 Mark and Marianna Matthews acquired Caledonia Australis, but there has been no change in the pre-existing management arrangements, notwithstanding the skills the Matthews bring to the table. Mark is a winemaker with vintages in numerous wine regions around the world, works as a winemaking teacher at NMIT, and also runs a contract winemaking business specialising in small high quality batches. Marianna has extensive experience with major fast-moving consumer goods brands globally. The Matthews have converted the main chardonnay block to certified organic, and are rehabilitating around 8ha of wetlands with the local catchment authority. Exports to Canada and Japan.
