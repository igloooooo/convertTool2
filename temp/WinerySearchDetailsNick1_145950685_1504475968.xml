            This is the small business of experienced winemaker Martin Slocombe and former Yalumba viticulturist Kylie McIntyre. They have established 1ha each of pinot noir and sauvignon blanc and 0.2ha of gewurztraminer, supplemented by grapes purchased from local growers. The modestly priced but well-made wines are principally sold through the cellar door on the property, a decrepit weatherboard shanty with one cold tap that has been transformed into a fully functional two-room tasting area, and through a number of local restaurants and bottle shops. The label design, incidentally, comes from a 1901 poster advertising the subdivision of the original Bochara property into smaller farms.
