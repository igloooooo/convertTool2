            Mary Byrnes, who has a wine science degree, acquired her property in 1991, and has since planted 4ha of shiraz, and 1ha each of marsanne, viognier, roussanne and mourvedre, and 0.5ha each of grenache and black hamburg muscat. She has deliberately grown the vines without irrigation, thereby limiting yield and (in her words) ensuring a distinctive regional quality and flavour. Exports to the UK and NZ.
