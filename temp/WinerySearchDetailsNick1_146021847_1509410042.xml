            Tony and Felicity Ruse have 9ha of chardonnay, merlot, cabernet franc, pinot noir, riesling and viognier in their vineyard 23km from Denmark. The wines are contract-made, and after some hesitation, the Ruses decided their very pretty garden and orchard more than justified opening a cellar door, a decision supported by the quality on offer at very reasonable prices.
