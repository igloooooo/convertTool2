            Dr Kenn Fisher and partner Meredyth Taylor planted pinot noir and chardonnay in 1998. The vineyard has five blocks, each with its own mesoclimate, orientation and soil type. To add further complexity, four clones have been utilised. With additional vine age, the use of new French oak has been increased to 30%. Kenn makes the wines using traditional Burgundian methods of open fermenters and a basket press.
