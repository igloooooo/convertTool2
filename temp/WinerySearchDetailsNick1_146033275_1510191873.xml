            This is the reincarnation of Pendarves Estate, originally planted by medico-cum-wine historian-cum wine health activist Dr Phillip Norrie. It was purchased by Graham Burns in January 2008, and vineyard manager Chris Dibley, who had previously worked in the vineyard, was brought back to 'get the place back up to scratch'. There is a Joseph's coat of plantings including verdelho (2.66ha), pinot noir (2.37ha), shiraz (2.1ha), chardonnay (1.83ha) and chambourcin (1.7ha), and lesser plantings of tannat, semillon and merlot. Wine quality is a little variable, but there are some nice wines currently available.
