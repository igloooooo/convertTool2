            Since taking ownership of Huntington Estate from the founding Roberts family,Tim Stevens has sensibly refrained from making major changes. On the wine side, the policy of having older vintage wines available is continuing, making the cellar door a first port of call for visitors to Mudgee. On the other side, the Music Festival suffers only one problem: there are simply not enough tickets to satisfy the demand. It really has a well-deserved life of its own, and I can see no reason why it should not do so for years to come.
