            John and Glenise Osborne, well-known Auburn hoteliers, established Eyre Creek in 1998. In 2008 they opened their cellar door, a renovated 100-year-old dairy, just north of Auburn. They grow dryland shiraz and grenache; the production is sold at the cellar door, by mail order and at selected bottle shops and restaurants in Adelaide and Sydney.
