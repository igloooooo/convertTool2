            At the ripe old age of 28, Nick OLeary had been involved in the wine industry for over a decade, working variously in retail, wholesale, viticulture and winemaking. Two years earlier he had laid the foundation for Nick OLeary Wines, purchasing shiraz from local vignerons (commencing in 2006) and riesling following in 08. His wines have had extraordinarily consistent success in local wine shows and competitions since the first vintages. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year.
