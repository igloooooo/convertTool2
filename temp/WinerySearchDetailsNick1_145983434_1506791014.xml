            Jinnunger Vineyard is owned by research scientist Colin Sanderson. There is 1 ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir, and while he expects to increase the plantings, it will always be a small, hand-tended vineyard. It is ideally situated, on a north-facing slope of Mt Mason close to the Southern Ocean, 18 km east of Albany. The name comes from the local Aboriginal (Nyungah) language, and means 'good views' (the property looks out over the Porongurup and Stirling Ranges).
