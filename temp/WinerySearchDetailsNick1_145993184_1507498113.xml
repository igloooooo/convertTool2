            A joint venture between Canadian-born and Burgundian-trained Pascal Marchand and the Burch family, which owns Howard Park. The wines include Chardonnay and Pinot Noir sourced from the Porongurup and Mount Barker subregions of the Great Southern, and Shiraz from Frankland River/Margaret River. The Chardonnay, in particular, is outstanding. The venture has extended to wines made by Pascal Marchand in Burgundy. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets..
