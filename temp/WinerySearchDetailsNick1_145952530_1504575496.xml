            Michael and Sheila Darch began the establishment of Brimsmore Park in 1998. Situated on the rolling hills of Merricks, it overlooks Westernport Bay and Phillip Island. The vineyard is exclusively planted to pinot noir: MV6 for half of the vineyard, and the Dijon clones 114 and 115 (a quarter each). The benefits of concentrating on one variety are obvious, especially so when that variety is pinot noir and the region is Mornington Peninsula.
