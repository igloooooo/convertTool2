            This is the new venture for Ros Ritchie and husband John. Ros was winemaker at the Ritchie familys Delatite winery from 1981 to 2006, but moved on to establish her own winery with John in 08. They lease a vineyard planted to merlot and cabernet sauvignon on a northeastern slope close to Mansfield. They source their white wines from growers who work in tandem with them to provide high quality grapes. Foremost are Gumbletons Vineyard, Retiefs Vineyard and Baxendales Vineyard,the last planted by the very experienced viticulturist Jim Baxendale (and wife Ruth) high on the Woodfield Plateau above the King River Valley. All the vineyards are managed with minimal spray regimes.
