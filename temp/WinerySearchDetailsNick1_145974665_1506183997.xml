            In 1983 Rino and Greta Ozzella purchased a small vineyard in McLaren Vale which had been planted in the early 1940s to a little under 3ha of grenache; the grapes were sold to other winemakers. Later, they planted a further 3ha of shiraz on a westerly slope facing the sea, and decided to establish their own brand. At the same time they began the conversion to organic production, which has now been certified (in conversion). Exports to China.
