            Michael Murtagh (and wife Lisa) are long-term industry professionals, Michael adding 150 years of family ownership in Rutherglen for good measure. His great-grandfather arrived from Ireland 150 years ago and named his property Tara, after a mystical hill in Ireland which was the meeting place of kings. The view from the 47ha property owned by Michael and Lisa prompted the name Vintara for the vineyard, which has a veritable patchwork quilt of 10 varieties. Most of the grapes are sold, but Vintara makes Riesling, Viognier, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Shiraz, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Durif.
