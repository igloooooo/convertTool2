            Alan and Jos Smith, stalwarts of the Yarra Valley for 30 years, had decided that the 2010 vintage would be their last. The decision came in the wake of 07 (frost, no vintage); 08 (drought and heat, only pinot noir made but sold in bulk); and 09 (drought, heat and smoke). The cellar door will remain open for several years until the wines are sold, and then it will be closed, but the Smiths will continue to live on the property with or without vines for as long as possible. In fact, Alans personal swan song was with the 11 Pinot Noir, which at the time of writing had not been bottled, let alone released. It is ironic that the last two pinots should be so good.
