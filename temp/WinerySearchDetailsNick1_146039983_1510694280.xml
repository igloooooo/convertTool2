            A legal contemporary of mine, whom I have known for over 40 years, is one of the faces behind Winbourne Wines. He still practises law at his law firm in Muswellbrook, but has also established a little under 50ha of vineyards planted to semillon, chardonnay, verdelho, shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. Most of the production is sold as grapes, a little made into wine. Says David White, It could well be wondered why we are doing  have done  this. I guess it simply proves that old lawyers are not necessarily wise lawyers.
