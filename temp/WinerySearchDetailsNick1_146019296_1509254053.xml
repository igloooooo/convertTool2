            Tammy Schutz (neÃÅe Pfeiffer) may be a sixth-generation grapegrower, but she was only 19 when in 1997 she purchased the 27-ha property now known as Schutz Barossa. At that time there were 2.4 ha of shiraz plantings, the remainder was grazing land with a beautiful view towards the Seppeltsfield palm avenue. The existing shiraz had been sourced from 80-year- old vines grown in the Moppa district, and Tammy has since added more shiraz and 2 ha of cabernet sauvignon. She carries out much of the work on the vineyards herself, using sustainable vineyard practices wherever possible. The Stonewell area, in which the vineyard is situated, is well known for its high-quality shiraz fruit. The winemaking is done by her good friend and cousin Troy Kalleske. Exports to France, Denmark, Russia and Malaysia.
