            Crane Winery was founded by John and Sue Crane; Sues great-grandfather had established a vineyard planted to shiraz in 1898, and which remained in production until 1970. However, Crane Winery was sold to Bernard and Judy Cooper in 2004; both Bernie and Judy have strong chemistry and microbiology backgrounds, which have enabled them to take over winemaking responsibility. In 2008, 0.7ha was removed to make room for planting of an equivalent amount of albarino and vermentino.
