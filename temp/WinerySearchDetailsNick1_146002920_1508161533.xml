            This is yet another AustralianUK joint venture in similar vein to Willunga 100 Wines. The UK end is distributor HwCg, while the Australian components include the former Evans &amp; Tateowned Salisbury Winery at Irymple, and Roberts Estate at Merbein. A $2 million upgrade of the Salisbury Winery was completed prior to the 2007 vintage. The wines come in three price levels: at the bottom is the Roberts Estate brand, the Commissioners Block next and, at the top, Calder Grove. Exports to the UK and Asia.
