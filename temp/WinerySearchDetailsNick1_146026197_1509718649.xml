            Frank and Wendy Zantvoort began planting their first vineyard in 1988; Wendy,having enrolled in the oenology course at CSU,subsequently graduated with B.App.Sc (Oenology). Together with son Michael, the Zantvoorts look after all aspects of grapegrowing and winemaking. In addition to the original vineyard, they have deliberately gone against prevailing thinking with their Moorooduc vineyard, planting it solely to red varieties, predominantly cabernet sauvignon, merlot and shiraz. They believe they have one of the warmest sites on the Peninsula, and that ripening will present no problems. (Peninsula Panorama is their second label.) Exports to all major markets.
