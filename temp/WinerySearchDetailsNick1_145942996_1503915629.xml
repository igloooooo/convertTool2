            A long time ago Wally Lewis (no relation to the celebrated rugby league player) and wife Dawn were third-generation graziers and sheep farmers. In 1985 they decided they had to find a much larger property further inland for their sheep farming, or radically change their existing business. They opted for the latter, simultaneously planting vines and flowers; they have planted shiraz, semillon, cabernet franc, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and 2ha of flowers. For almost 20 years they sold the grapes to a nearby winemaker, but in 2006 took the plunge and established their own brand. Ambience and the Anniebrook River, which flows through the centre of the property, are ready attractions for cellar door visitors.
