            Dookie has a long history of teaching winemaking and viticulture dating back to the end of the 19th century. These days it is part of the University of Melbourne, and as well as being a teaching winery acts as a contract winemaking facility for boutique winemakers. Its estate vineyards, on soil similar to that of Heathcote, are planted to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc and semillon.
