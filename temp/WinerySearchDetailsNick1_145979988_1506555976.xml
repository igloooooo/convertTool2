            Jane Bromley and Hylton McLean planted 0.4ha each of pinot noir (clones 777, 114 and 115) and shiraz (selected from two old vineyards known for their spicy fruit flavours) in 2003. The moon is a striking feature in the landscape, particularly at harvest time when, as a full moon, it appears as a dollop of rich honey in the sky  hence the name. The first vintage was 05, but Jane has been making wine since 01, with a particular interest in Champagne; Hylton is a winemaker, wine science researcher and wine educator with over 20 years experience.
