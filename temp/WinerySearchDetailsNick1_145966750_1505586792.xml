            Erica and David Dillon established Eagles Rise in 1996, on a property 5km from the township of Bannockburn. In the early years, the grapes were exclusively sold to Southcorp, but (as so often has been the case) that exclusive arrangement no longer continues. Since 2003 Eagles Rise has been making wine in limited but commercial quantities, making Sparkling Pinot Gris, Sparkling Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Shiraz Cabernet, Cabernet Sauvignon and a Fortified Late Pick Pinot Gris. The winery has had success at the Geelong Wine Show.
