            John Howard Angas (who arrived in SA in 1843, aged 19, charged with the responsibility of looking after the affairs of his father, George Fife Angas) named part of the family estate Hutton Vale. It is here that John Angas, Johns great-great-grandson, and wife Jan tend 27ha of vines. Almost all the grapes are sold, but a tiny quantity has been made by the whos who of the Barossa Valley, notably David Powell of Torbreck. Jan is also chair of Regional Food SA.
