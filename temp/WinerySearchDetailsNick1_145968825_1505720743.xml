            The Ey family arrived in Coonawarra in 1908, establishing a mixed farming business on terra rossa soil just to the north of the Coonawarra township. Between 1988 and 98, third generation Robin Ey, and fourth generation son Peter Ey, have established 20ha of cabernet sauvignon, 4ha of chardonnay and 2ha of shiraz, planted in five separate blocks. Most of the grapes are sold under contract, with a small amount made by Pat Tocaciu.
