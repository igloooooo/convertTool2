            Bob and Annie Browning have been progressively establishing 3ha of pinot noir, 1ha of sauvignon blanc, a little over 1ha of riesling and 0.5ha of chardonnay since 1998. The name comes from a famous lighthouse four miles west of the Scilly Isles which the Brownings felt was similar to the Oyster Bay area near their vineyard site.
