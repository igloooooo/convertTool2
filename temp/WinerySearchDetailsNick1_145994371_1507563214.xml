            This is the very successful venture of Ronald Brown, Jeremy Vogler and Adrian Bell. Taking advantage of excess grape production in Australia, the partners have acquired four vineyards in key areas of the Eden Valley and Barossa Valley, with vines ranging in age from 40 to over 140 years. The wines are made in small batches in tanks of 0.53-tonne capacity, and are then matured in French oak. Maverick has achieved listings in top restaurants and fine wine retailers in Australia and internationally. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, France, Scandinavia, Russia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan. China.
