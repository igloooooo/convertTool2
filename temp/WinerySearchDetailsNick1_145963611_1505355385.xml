            This is the venture of research scientist Charles (Charlie) Svenson and wife Loretta. Charlie became interested in winemaking when, aged 32, he returned to study microbiology and biochemistry at the University of NSW. His particular area of interest (for his PhD) was the yeast and bacterial fermentation of cellulosic waste to produce ethanol. In 09, after a prolonged search, Charlie and Loretta purchased a vineyard first planted in 1993 and known as Wattleview (now renamed Lofty Vineyard).At an altitude of 1050m it is the highest vineyard in the Orange GI, and their winery was built and equipped in time for the 09 vintage. In 12, De Salis vinified shiraz, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon from vineyards in Boree Lane (near Canobolas-Smith).
