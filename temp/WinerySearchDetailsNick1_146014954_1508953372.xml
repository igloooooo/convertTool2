            This is the venture of Bruce and Annie Holm, Bruce having been involved in large scale commercial wine production in Griffith and Mildura for 30 years before getting itchy feet. In 1996 he and Annie began searching for an appropriate property before finding an ideal 35ha property at Porepunkah. The first vines were planted in '98, and, except during vintage, Bruce travelled from Mildura every weekend to maintain the property. In 2000 they moved to Porepunkah, Bruce working first at Gapsted Wines, then with Sam Miranda Wines before 'retiring' in '08. In the meantime a winery and cellar door sales had been built in '05, and they now have a Joseph's Coat of chardonnay, merlot, montepulciano, moscato giallo, nebbiolo, petit manseng, pinot noir, sangiovese and sauvignon blanc. A trip to Italy in August '11 led to further plantings of nebbiolo, and by '13 it is expected that all the wines will be produced from estate-grown grapes.
