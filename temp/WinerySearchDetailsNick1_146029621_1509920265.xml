            The Dean family  Pat and Henry, and sons Duncan, Nick and Alan  purchased a 30ha dairy farm at Balhannah in late 1994, and planted 6.5ha of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and semillon in the spring of 95, subsequently adding 0.67ha of shiraz. Pinot noir and a tiny block of sangiovese were also planted at a property at Piccadilly. A further 8ha are now being developed on a third property, adjacent to the original Balhannah holding. Alan Dean, a CSU-trained viticulturist and former Petaluma vineyard manager, is in charge of the vineyards, working alongside brother Duncan. The primary aim of the business is contract grapegrowing, the purchasers including some high-profile names.
