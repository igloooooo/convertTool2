            Adam Foster worked as a chef in Vic and London before moving to the front of house and becoming increasingly interested in wine. He then worked as a cellar hand with a whos who in Australia and France, including Torbreck, Chapoutier, Mitchelton, Domaine Ogier, Heathcote Winery, Jasper Hill and Domaine Pierre Gaillard. He became convinced that the Cambrian soils of Heathcote could produce the best possible Shiraz, and since 2004 has purchased grapes from the region, using the full bag of open-ferment techniques, with whole bunches, extended cold-soak, wild yeast and mlf and hand-plunging, then 13 months in French oak, bottled unfined and unfiltered. Exports to the US and Japan.
