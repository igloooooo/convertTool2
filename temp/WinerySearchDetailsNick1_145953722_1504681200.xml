            Over the past 20+ years, Mike Calneggia has had his fingers in innumerable Margaret River viticultural pies. He has watched ventures succeed, others fail, and while Bunkers Wines (owned by Mike and Sally Calneggia) is only a small part of his viticultural undertakings, it has been carefully targeted from the word go. It has the five mainstream varieties (cabernet, semillon, merlot, chardonnay and shiraz) joined by one rising star, tempranillo, in the warm and relatively fertile northern part of the Margaret River. He has secured the services of the immensely experienced Brian Fletcher as winemaker, and Murray Edmonds as viticulturist (both formerly at Evans &amp; Tate). Mike and daughter Amy are responsible for sales and?marketing, supported by direct sales specialist Cat Duncan. They say, The world of wine is full of serious people making serious wines for an ever-decreasing serious market... Bunkers wines have been created to put the F word back into wine: FUN, that is. Exports to Canada and Hong Kong.
