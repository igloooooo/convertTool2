            Shane and Lynne Colbert have planted 1.4ha of shiraz and 0.6ha of cabernet sauvignon for their estate-grown red wines, extending the range with Chardonnay and Verdelho made from contract-grown grapes. The cellar door overlooks the vineyard and the Mandurang Valley below, and has been expanded to create a conference/function facility, a restaurant and B&amp;B. They also offer day tours of local wineries, including lunch.
