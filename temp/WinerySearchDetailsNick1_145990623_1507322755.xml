            Little Brampton Wines is a boutique, family-owned business operated by Alan and Pamela Schwarz. They purchased their 24ha property in the heart of the Clare Valley in the early 1990s (Alan had graduated from Roseworthy in 1981). The property had produced grapes?since the 1860s, but the vineyard had been removed during the Vine Pull Scheme of the 1980s. The Schwarzs have replanted riesling (2ha), shiraz and cabernet sauvignon (4ha each) on northwest slopes at 520 m; a small proportion of the production is vinified for the Little Brampton label. Exports to the UK and Singapore.
