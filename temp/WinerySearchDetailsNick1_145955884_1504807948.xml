            Doug and Carolyn May are the third generation of farmers at the Captains Creek property, and have been conducting the business for over 20 years without using any chemicals. When they began establishing the vineyard in 1994, with chardonnay (1.5ha) and pinot noir (0.5ha), they resolved to go down the same path: they use preventive spray programs of copper and sulphur, thermal flame weeding, and beneficial predatory insects to control weeds and mites.
