            Whyworry was originally a sheep station set up after the Second World War to produce superfine merino wool for export to the Italian market. Owners Darryl and Robyn Carter have now ventured into grapegrowing, having planted 14ha of chardonnay, verdelho, sauvignon blanc, riesling, gewurztraminer, pinot noir, merlot, shiraz, pinot gris, pinotage (the odd man out), and viognier. The vines are 1150m above sea level on a property 3.5km west of Uralla, in turn, just south of Armidale.
