            David Paxton is one of Australias best-known viticulturists and consultants. He founded Paxton Vineyards in McLaren Vale with his family in 1979, and has since been involved in various capacities in the establishment and management of vineyards in several leading regions across the country. Son Michael, a former Flying Winemaker (with experience in Spain, South America, France and Australia), is responsible for making the wines. There are five vineyards in the family holdings: the Thomas Block (28ha), the Jones Block (22ha), Quandong Farm (19ha), Landcross Farm (2ha) and Maslin Vineyard (3.5ha). By 2006 all of the vineyards were managed using full biodynamic principles. Paxton has become one of the first members of 1% For the Planet (www.onepercentfortheplanet.org). An underground barrel store has been completed and a cellar door opened in the original shearing shed. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Taiwan and China.
