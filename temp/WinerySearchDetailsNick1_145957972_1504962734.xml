            In 2004 owner Greg Dowker planted the vineyard on a historic property just 5 min from the centre of Mudgee, nestled at the foot of the surrounding hills of the Cudgegong Valley. He has established shiraz (1.5ha) and merlot (0.5ha), the wines contract-made by former Flying Winemaker Jacob Stein. No wines were produced in 2010 due to the high volume of rain during the growing season, the 11 wines were not ready in time for inclusion in the 2013 Wine Companion.
