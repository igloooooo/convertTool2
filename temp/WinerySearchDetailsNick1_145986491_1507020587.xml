            The Gould family has been farming in WA since 1907, and still owns the land grant taken up on their arrival from Scotland. In 1997 two generations of the family decided to diversify, and acquired Knotting Hill, their Wilyabrup property in the Margaret River. In 98, using their extensive farming background, they propagated 56 000 cuttings by hand in an onsite nursery, supervised plantings, created a 5.5ha dam, and built the 45m bridge entry to the local limestone cellar door. In 2002 they leased the wheat farm, and have since devoted all their time to Knotting Hill. The spectacular vineyard setting is established on a natural amphitheatre, with the lake at the bottom.
