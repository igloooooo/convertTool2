            Burton Premium Wines has neither vineyards nor winery, purchasing its grapes from McLaren Vale and Coonawarra, and having its wines made in various locations by contract winemakers. It brings together the marketing and financial skills of managing director Nigel Burton, and the extensive wine experience (as a senior wine show judge) of Dr Ray Healy, who is director in charge of winemaking. Exports to Indonesia and Singapore.
