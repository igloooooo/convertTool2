            While this is the venture of Bob and Sylvia Franchitto, it has been set up for the benefit of their son Tyrone. When Bob began his various horticultural and farming activities, he applied a holistic view, preferring the use of selected cover crops and mulching instead of chemicals for weed control and soil conditioning. Care for the environment also extends to the winemaking process: the winery is fully undercover, eliminating stormwater run off and allowing the collection of rainwater for further use. The water used in winery wash-down procedures is processed before being recycled for supplementary irrigation of the vineyards. All the marc and grape skins are taken offsite and distilled to recover alcohol and tartaric acid before being combined with other ingredients for organic fertilisers. This is a sister winery to Salena Estate.  Exports to Canada, Sweden, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China.
