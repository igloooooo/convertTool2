            Owners Pam and Tony Barich have established their vineyard and house on the banks of the Murray River, a haven for wildlife. They believe custodians of the land have a duty to maintain its health and vitality, and their vineyard has had organic certification for almost a decade, and biodynamic certification since 2008.
