            In 2004 John and Stephanie Henry planted 0.5ha of shiraz, with four different clones, and the results so far have been impressive. The name comes from northeast Arnhem Land, and means where the land touches the Milky Way. The Henrys have been given permission by Arnhem Land artist, Nami Maymuru-White, to reproduce one of her paintings of the Milky Way on their label.
