            Vicarys justifiably claims to be the Sydney regions oldest continuously operating winery, having been established in a large and very attractive stone shearing shed built about 1890. Most of the wines come from other parts of Australia, but the winery does draw upon 1ha of estate traminer and 3ha of chardonnay for those wines, and has produced some good wines of all styles over the years.
