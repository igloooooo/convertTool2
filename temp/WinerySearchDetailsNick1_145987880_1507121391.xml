            Michael, Belinda, Peter and Helen Chambers are members of the famous Chambers family of Rutherglen. The vineyards (tended by Peter), include the Italian grape variety biancone, a vineyard specialty made in a light-bodied late-harvest style. The cellar door sits high above Lake Moodemere, and gourmet hampers can be arranged with 24 hours notice.
