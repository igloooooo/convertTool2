            Bob and Margaret Torrens began the development of Mopoke Ridge Wines with the planting of cabernet sauvignon in 1998 (0.4 ha), followed by 1 ha of merlot, verdelho and sangiovese in 2000. The most recent addition has been the planting of a few vines of chambourcin. It is a beautifully situated vineyard, in bushland overlooking the Shoalhaven River.
