            Ian and Margaret Pym began planting their tiny vineyard in 1995 with 1280 pinot noir rootlings, adding 450 chardonnay rootlings the next year. Since 2001 the wine has been made and released under the Mount Coghill Vineyard label. Ian is an award-winning photographer, and his photographs are on display at the cellar door.
