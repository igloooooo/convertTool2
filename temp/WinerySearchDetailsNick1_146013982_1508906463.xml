            John Reynell laid the foundations for Chateau Reynella in 1838; over the next 100 years the stone buildings and cellars, with patches of lawn and leafy gardens were constructed. Thomas Hardys first job in SA was with Reynella, noting in his diary that he would be able to better himself soon. He did just that, becoming by far the largest producer in SA by the end of the 19th century; 150 or so years after Chateau Reynellas foundation CWA (now Accolade Wines) completed the circle by acquiring it and making it corporate headquarters, while preserving the integrity of the Reynella brand in no uncertain fashion. In a sign of the times, Chateau has been dropped from its name. Exports to Canada, Europe and China.
