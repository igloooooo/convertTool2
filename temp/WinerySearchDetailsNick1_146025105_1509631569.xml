            Croatian-born Tomo Steler had a tough upbringing as an orphan in his native country, but he overcame many obstacles to obtain a degree in forestry before migrating to Australia in 1970. Shortly thereafter he met wife Suzanna, and together they established a successful UV coating and spray-painting business. They planted their first vines in 1996, intending simply to make wine for their own consumption, but further plantings in 97 have resulted in a little less than a ha of shiraz and merlot.
