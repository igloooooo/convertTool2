            A series of events in 2007 led to major changes in the Arlewood Estate structure. The Gosatti family sold the Harmans Road vineyard to Vasse Felix, but retained ownership of the brand and all stock. In mid 08 Arlewood acquired the former Hesperos Estate vineyard, 10km south of Margaret River, and Bill Crappsley, already a partner with the Gosattis in Plan B (see separate entry), became full-time winemaker for Arlewood and Plan B. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Philippines and China.
