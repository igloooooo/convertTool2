            Charles and Jill Macek purchased the vineyard from founder Maree Tayler in 2005. Charles is a distinguished company director (Telstra,Wesfarmers). Lake Barringtons primary focus is on high quality sparkling wine, and it has won many trophies and gold medals over the years at the Tasmanian Wine Show; it makes lesser quantities of high quality chardonnay and pinot noir. There are picnic facilities at the vineyard and, needless to say, the scenery is very beautiful.
