            Relying upon advice from his soil scientist father in selecting the property, Greg Bettenay began planting the vineyards in 1989, and now has cabernet sauvignon (4.5ha), chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, shiraz (1.5ha each), semillon and merlot (1ha each). The development also extends to two cottages and a luxury treetop spa apartment known as The Lakeside Loft. The third generation has joined the business in the form of son Bryce, bringing yet another perspective to the winemaking.
