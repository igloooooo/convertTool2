            Noell and John McNamara and Judy Doyle planted pinot noir in 1996 and 97. The vineyard stands high on the southern slopes of the Cobaw Ranges with an 1862 settlers cottage still standing. At an altitude of 600m, even pinot ripens very late in the season, typically at the end of April or early May, but in the right years the results can be impressive.
