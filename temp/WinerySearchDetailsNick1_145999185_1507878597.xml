            In 1992 Judy Barrett purchased this historic property, the house built in 1867, and (with her family) spent the next 10 years repairing years of neglect and planting 10ha each of pinot gris, chardonnay and pinot noir. Most of the grapes are sold, but the wines made are sold through the estates accommodation, conference and function centre, and cellar door.
