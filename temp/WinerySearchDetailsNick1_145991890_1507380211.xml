            The Falls Vineyard was planted by Andrew and Elly Cameron way back in 1969, as a minor diversification for their pastoral company. Two ha of shiraz provides both the Longwood Shiraz and the Longwood Reserve Shiraz. The exceptionally beautiful property was sold at the end of 2005, but wine sales are continuing.
