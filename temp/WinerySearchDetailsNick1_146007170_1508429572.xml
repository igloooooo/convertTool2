            Denis and Pauline Pasut have 10ha of vineyards, with a very interesting range of varietals planted: pinot gris, sangiovese, barbera, fragola, nebbiolo and vermentino, all of which (with the qualified exception of pinot gris) are grapes grown chiefly in Italy. If the varieties planted are exotic, the brands are more so: Pasut, Pinkbits, Fatbelly and Alpino Misto.
