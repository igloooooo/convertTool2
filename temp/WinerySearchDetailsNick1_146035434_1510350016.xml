            With 50-year-old, dry-grown and near-organic vineyards yielding 11.5 tonnes per acre, Viking Wines was discovered by Robert Parker Jr with inevitable consequences for the price of its top Shiraz. There are 5ha of shiraz and 3ha of cabernet sauvignon. The Odins Honour wines (made by sister company Todd-Viking Wines) also come from old (20100 years) dry-grown vines around Marananga and Greenock. Exports to the US, the UK, Singapore and France.
