            Gus del Rio, of Spanish heritage, established a vineyard in 1996 on the slopes of Mt Anakie, northwest of Geelong (chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, merlot and marsanne). The vines are hand-pruned, the fruit is hand-picked and the wines are made onsite in the fully equipped winery, which includes a bottling and labelling line able to process over 150 tonnes. Exports to China.
