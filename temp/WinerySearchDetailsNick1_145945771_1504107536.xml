            When Kim and Bernadette Chambers purchased the Banksia Grove vineyard in early 2002, they inherited some of the oldest vines in Heathcote, planted in the late 1970s. The prior owners had sold the grapes each year, and made no wine. The Chambers have worked hard to restore the somewhat dilapidated vineyard they inherited, and have extended the plantings by 2 ha, so that there are now 5ha of shiraz, and 0.6ha each of cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. The wines are released with some bottle age.
