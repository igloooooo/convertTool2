            Robyn Drayton inherited the business started by her parents following their death in a plane crash in 1994. Together with her sons, Justin, Liam and Taylor, she has grown the business?exponentially. The cellar door has been expanded twice, a new caf and function centre opened, and an additional 6ha of vines planted. Robyn is a fifth-generation Drayton, and continues the proud tradition of over 150 years of Drayton winemaking in the Hunter Valley.
