            The Karanto property was purchased in 1910 by PR Dodd, who established a mixed horticultural venture. In 1979 it came into the ownership of Dodds granddaughter Zonda and husband Dennis Elliott, who progressively changed the 44ha property into a single-purpose viticultural enterprise. Until 2002 all the grapes were sold to major wine companies, but in that year the Elliotts made their first Shiraz; both it and the 03 won significant accolades. The Shiraz continues, and the Elliotts have since established 0.5ha each of aglianico, greco di tufo, primitivo, fiano and 2.5ha of pinot grigio, the first vines made over the 2007 to 09 vintages. The wines are made by former Australian Young Winemaker of the Year, Briony Hoare.
