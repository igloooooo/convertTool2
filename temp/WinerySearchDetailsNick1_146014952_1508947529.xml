            Rileys of Eden Valley is owned by parents Terry and Jan with son Peter Riley,who way back in 1982 purchased 32ha of a grazing property that they believed had potential for quality grape production. The first vines were planted in that year and over the next 16 years plantings extended to 7.2 ha. Minimal planting has occurred since, but in 08 0.8ha of merlot were grafted to savagnin (in the belief that it was albarino). In 98 Terry retired from his position of Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of SA, allowing him to concentrate on the vineyard, and, more recently, winemaking activities, but the whole family (including granddaughter Maddy) have been involved in the development of the property. It had always been intended that the grapes would be sold, but when not all the grapes were contracted in 06, the Rileys decided to produce some wine (even though they ended up with buyers for all of the production that year).
