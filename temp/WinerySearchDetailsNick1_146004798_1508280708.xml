            Emily McNally (ne Laughton) has decided to follow in her parents footsteps after first seeing the world and having a range of casual jobs. Having grown up at Jasper Hill, winemaking was far from strange, but she decided to find her own way, buying the grapes from a small vineyard owned by Jasper Hill employee Andrew Conforti and his wife Melissa. She then made the wine with guidance and inspiration from my father. The name comes from William of Ockham (12851349), also spelt Occam, a theologian and philosopher responsible for many sayings, including that appearing on the back label of the wine: what can be done with fewer is done in vain with more. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada and NZ.
