            Michael and Kerry Dunbabin have one of the most historic properties in Tasmania, dating back to 1826. The property is 1800ha, meaning the vineyard (2.7ha of pinot noir, 1.4ha of riesling, 1.2ha of pinot gris and 1ha of gewurztraminer) has plenty of room for expansion. Michael says,Ive planted some of the newer pinot clones in 2001, but have yet to plant what I reckon will prove to be some of the best vineyard sites on the property. Initially the grapes were sold to Hardys, but since 05 most of the production has been retained for the Milton Vineyard label. Exports to Japan.
