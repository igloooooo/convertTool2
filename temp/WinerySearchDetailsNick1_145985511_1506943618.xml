            Paul and Mary Clark purchased what is now the Kersbrook Hill property, then grazing land, in 1997, planting 0.4ha of shiraz on a reality-check basis. Encouraged by the results, they increased the plantings to 3ha of shiraz and 1ha of riesling two years later. Yet further expansion of the vineyards has seen the area under vine increased to 11 ha, cabernet sauvignon (with 6ha) the somewhat unusual frontrunner. Mark Whisson is consultant viticulturist (Mark has been growing grapes in the Adelaide Hills for over 20 years). Peter Schell makes the Cabernet Sauvignon and Dons Acre Shiraz, Simon Greenleaf the rest of the wines. Exports to the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
