            The Fisicaro family continues to own and run the business that was founded by the late Joe Fisicaro. The name comes from the rolling dune region of the Peninsula known as the cups country; the soils are light, with relatively low fertility, but drainage is excellent. Wind and frost have been problems, and the composition of the vineyard has been somewhat modified by a grafting program placing more emphasis on early ripening varieties (pinot noir, shiraz, pinot gris, chardonnay, merlot and moscato).
