            When James Williamson decided to plant vines on his 4ha Moorooduc property and establish a micro-winery, he already knew it was far cheaper to buy wine by the bottle than to make it. Undeterred, he ventured into grapegrowing and winemaking, picking the first grapes in 1993 and opening Barak Estate in 96. Old telegraph poles, railway sleepers, old palings and timber shingles have all been used in the construction of the picturesque winery.
