            This is one of a portfolio of brands under the corporate umbrella of Australian Fermenters, founded and owned by Robert and Laurie Fraser-Scott. The other brands are Third Wheel, Birds of a Feather and Winston Lake Estate. Each has numerous labels, some as subsets (thus Birds of a Feather has six Reserve varietal wines and eight Humming Bird wines). In March 2012 the number of labels had risen from 52 to 60, precisely the opposite to what I had expected. Extraordinary show success continues, including the trophy for Best Semillon Sauvignon Blanc at the Margaret River Wine Show 11 for the Brygon Reserve Bin 828 Semillon Sauvignon Blanc 11. The remarkable price range of $15 to $30 continues, and the business has now opened an office in China. Exports to the US, Vietnam, Macau, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and China.
