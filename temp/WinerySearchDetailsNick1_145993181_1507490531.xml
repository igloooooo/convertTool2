            Industry veteran Dorham Mann has established a one-wine label for what must be Australias most unusual wine: a dry, only faintly pink, sparkling wine made exclusively from cabernet sauvignon (1.8ha) and cygne blanc (0.5ha) grown on the estate surrounding the cellar door. Dorham explains, Our family has made and enjoyed the style for more than 30 years, although just in a private capacity until recently.
