            This is a joint venture between Bill Crappsley, a 44-year veteran winemaker/consultant; Martin Miles, who has a wine distribution business in the southwestern part of the state; Gary Gosatti, of Arlewood Estate; and Terry Chellappah, wine consultant and now also in partnership with Gary. The Shiraz is sourced from Bills Calgardup Vineyard, the remaining wines from Arlewood, and all are single vineyard releases. It has been a notably successful Plan B, the estate vineyards increasing from 8ha, and production up from 7000 dozen. Exports to the UK, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
