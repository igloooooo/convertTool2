            Glenn Olsen, a science and engineering graduate of the University of Melbourne, has been involved in the wine industry since 1975, initially importing wines and spirits from Europe, then moving into retailing. In 1991, he and Angie Joson-Olsen started Olsen Wines, claiming to be Melbournes first inner-suburban winery. Several others may dispute this claim, but that is perhaps neither here nor there. Most of the wines come either from grapes grown on the Murray River in Northeast Victoria (for the full-bodied Big Fella range), or from the Yarra Valley. Exports to the US, Canada, Philippines, Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
