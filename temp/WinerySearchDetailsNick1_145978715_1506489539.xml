            The Francis family, headed by Ro and Grosvenor Francis, have operated a sheep, wheat and cattle property at Dunedoo for several generations. When they handed over the property to their sons in 1995, Ro and Grosvenor subdivided and retained a 40ha block on which they have since established 11ha of shiraz, 6ha of cabernet sauvignon and 5ha of chardonnay.
