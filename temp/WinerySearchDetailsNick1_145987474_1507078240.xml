            Aline and Philippe Prudhomme combine a vineyard (selling most of the grapes, but having some contract-made for La Colline) and a 70-seat licensed restaurant featuring the French provincial cuisine from the land of their birth. The cellar door and restaurant are 6km from Orange, with views of the Towac Valley.
