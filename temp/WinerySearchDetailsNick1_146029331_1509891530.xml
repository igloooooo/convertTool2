            The Gartner family (parents Phil and Mandy, and three children,Taylor, Abbi and Cooper) has been involved in grapegrowing in Coonawarra for 20 or so years, and also runs a company managing 300ha of vineyards in Coonawarra and Padthaway. With the downwards pressure on grape prices, in 2009 they decided to keep part of the crop from their 31ha of owned vineyards (20ha of cabernet sauvignon, 3ha merlot, 3.5 sauvignon blanc, 4.5 shiraz) and venture into the wine market. They chose Barbara Harkness, the Adelaide designer famous for creating the yellow tail label, to come up with a name and a label design. The name is doggerel Italian, terra for earth and amore for love, thus for the love of wine.
