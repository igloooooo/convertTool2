            In 1985 Mark Whisson and Bruce Lake planted the vertigo-inducing, east-facing slope of Mt Carey to 5 ha of pinot noir. The Whisson Lake vineyard rises to over 600 m above sea level and is situated within the Piccadilly Valley area of the Adelaide Hills. The majority of the vineyard’s small crop is sold to some of SA’s most prestigious winemakers but a few tonnes are held back each year to create the flagship White Label and entry level Pinot Gaz. In 2003 Bill Bissett joined the Whisson Lake partnership, and in ’08 Tom Munro joined to lead sales.
