            The Long Road name was inspired by the circuitous path taken by owners Barbara Cosson and Martin McKinnon towards establishment of their vineyard. Both immigrants to Australia  one from Scotland, the other NZ  they quickly came face to face with the Australian outback when, in 1999, they planted 7.5ha of shiraz, 3ha of cabernet sauvignon and 1.4ha of pinot noir. Challenges included leaking dams, a rare black beetle pest, and the impact of hail and drought. The infertile soils and constant wind moderate vine growth, keeping yields low and around 3.75 tonnes per ha. Elgo Estate (Cameron Atkins) has been responsible for the wines since 2004, the earlier vintage made by Sam Plunkett.
