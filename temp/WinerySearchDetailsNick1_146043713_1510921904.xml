            Michael and Susan Papps (neYelland) set up this venture after their marriage in 2005. Susan decided she did not want to give up her surname entirely, and thus has been able to keep her family name in the business. Michael has the technical background, having lived in the Barossa Valley for more than 20 years, working at local wineries, bottling facilities and wine technology businesses. Susan, who grew up on the Yorke Peninsula, headed to New York for a year, working and studying at the Windows of the World Wine School. The quantity of wine made is limited by the scarcity of the high quality grapes they manage to secure from the Greenock area for their wines. Exports to China.
