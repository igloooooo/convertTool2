            The establishment date of any winery can have a wide number of meanings. In this instance it is the date of the first vintage, but Colleen and Joe Borrett planted 8ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon many years ago, selling the majority of the grapes to Bleasdale and others. A small parcel of shiraz not under contract gave them the opportunity to move into the winemaking business, now extended with a little cabernet sauvignon. Exports to the UK and the US.
