            The Hunter Park business is based on 80 ha of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc managed by Andrew Dibley. The wines are not widely distributed in Australia (although they are available by mail order) but exports have been established to the UK, the US and Germany.
