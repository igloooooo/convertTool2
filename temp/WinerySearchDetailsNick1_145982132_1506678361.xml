            Iron Pot Bay was established by the Cuthbert family and continues in family ownership. The vineyard takes its name from a bay on the Tamar River (now called West Bay) and is strongly maritime influenced, producing delicate but intensely flavoured unwooded white wines. Over half of the vineyard is planted to chardonnay, the remainder to semillon, sauvignon blanc, pinot gris, gewurztraminer and riesling.
