            Coonabarabran is known for its sheep grazing, but most emphatically not for viticulture. As far north of Sydney as Port Macquarie, it is 440km west of that town, with the striking Warrumbungle Range on one side and the national park on the other. The modest production is sold through three outlets in Coonabarabran, and exported to Gunnedah and Boggabri.
