            This is the venture of the Avila family, with roots going back to the Castilla y Leon region of Spain, and the ancient city of Avila. Planting of the vineyard began in 2001 (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot) and the vines are grown organically, although not yet certified as such. The Semillon Sauvignon Blanc, with a string of medals to its credit, is made from purchased grapes, one suspects from the Margaret River or similar region. Exports to China and Hong Kong.
