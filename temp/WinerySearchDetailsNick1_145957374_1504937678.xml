            Chapman Valley Wines is WAs most northern winery, situated 30km northeast of Geraldton in the picturesque valley which gives the business its name. A hobby vineyard on a nearby property led to the establishment of 5ha of vines in 1995, followed by a further 3ha in 99 comprising semillon, chenin blanc, chardonnay, verdelho, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and zinfandel.
