            Yet another partnership between medicine and winemaking: Dr Graham Stephens is a GP in Healesville, and together with wife Lynda has established a vineyard (split evenly between chardonnay and pinot noir) and a supplementary olive plantation on a 12ha property west of Healesville. One-third of the grapes are sold to Sergio Carlei, the remainder retained for the Leayton Estate label. Graham is still working full-time as a doctor, but intends to gradually wind back his medical hours and spend more time in the vineyard and winemaking.
