            The Adams family has been growing grapes at Langhorne Creek since 1891, when the first vines at the famed Metala vineyards were planted. Guy Adams is the fifth generation to own and work the vineyard, and over the past 20 years has both improved the viticulture and expanded the plantings. It was not until 1998 that they decided to hold back a small proportion of the production for vinification under the Brothers in Arms label, and now they dedicate 80ha to the Brothers in Arms wines (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, malbec and petit verdot); the grapes from the remaining 200ha are sold. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets account for 60% of total sales.
