            Jock Calder and his family began the establishment of Cawdor Wines with the purchase of 22 ha near Echunga; 5 ha of sauvignon blanc were planted in 1999, with a further 2.6 ha of sauvignon blanc, 7.9 ha of shiraz and 2.7 ha of riesling the following year. The major part of the production is sold to Nepenthe, but Cawdor nominates how much it wishes to have vinified under its own label each year. It has followed a softly, softly approach, with only small amounts being made. </description></item></WineryInfoDetails></extraction>
