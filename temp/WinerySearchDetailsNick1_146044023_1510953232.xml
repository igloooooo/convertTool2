            Yrsas Vineyard honours the lady from whom Steven and Marianne Stern acquired the property. She, in turn, was named after Queen Yrsa of Sweden, born in 565 AD, whose story is told in the Norse Sagas. Well-known patent and trademark attorney Steven Stern (whose particular area of expertise is in the wine and liquor business) and wife Marianne planted 2.75ha each of pinot noir and chardonnay. When they recently sold the vineyard, they simultaneously entered into a purchase contract for its annual grape production.
