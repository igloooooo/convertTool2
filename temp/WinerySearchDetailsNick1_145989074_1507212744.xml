            In 2011 Mark and Sarah Hirst purchased the then 20-year-old Lalla Gully Vineyard from long-term owner Taltarni. Sarah has a background in journalism, media, event management and wine marketing; Mark has years of experience in agriculture, accounting and business management. Its difficult not to describe that as a match made in heaven. They appointed Guy Wagner as winemaker, and their 10 Sauvignon Blanc won the trophy for Best Other White Wine at the Tasmanian Wine Show 11, their first foray into the world of wine shows. Guy was prescient when he declared it one of the best Sauvignon Blancs hes ever made a week or two before the show was held.
