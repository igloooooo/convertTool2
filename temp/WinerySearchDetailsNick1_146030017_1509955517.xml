            Having sold their previous winery, Ian and Suzanne Little moved in stages to their new winery at Broke. The Little Wine Company is part-owner of the 20ha Lochleven Vineyard in Pokolbin, and contracts three vineyards in the Broke Fordwich area (where the winery is situated). It also has access to the Talga Vineyard in the Gundaroo Valley near Canberra. Exports to Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Japan.
