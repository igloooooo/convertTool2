            A highly successful winery in terms of the quality of its wines, as well as their reach outwards from the Hunter Valley. The Capercaillie wines have always been particularly well made, with generous flavour. Following the example of Brokenwood, its fruit sources are spread across South Eastern Australia, although the portfolio includes high quality wines that are 100% Hunter Valley. The business is owned by Patricia Sutherland following the sudden death of husband Alasdair. Exports to the UK, Dubai and China.
