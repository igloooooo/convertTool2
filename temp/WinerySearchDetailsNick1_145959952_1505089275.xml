            Claymore Wines is the venture of a medical professional imagining that it would lead the way to early retirement (which, of course, it did not). The starting date depends on which event you take: the first 4ha vineyard at Leasingham purchased in 1991 (with 70-year-old grenache, riesling and shiraz); 96, when a 16ha block at Penwortham was purchased and planted to shiraz, merlot and grenache; 97, when the first wines were made; or 98, when the first releases came onto the market. The labels are inspired by U2, Pink Floyd and Lou Reed. Exports to Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.
