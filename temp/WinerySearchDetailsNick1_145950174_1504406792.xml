            Barry Scrivener and Robyn Meloury have established a little over 3ha of chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot, all made as easy-drinking styles with the emphasis on fresh fruit. The vines are mostly unirrigated, and managed by John Corich, who has over 50 years vineyard experience.
