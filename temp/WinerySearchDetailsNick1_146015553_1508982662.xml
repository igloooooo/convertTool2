            The home base for Robert Johnson is a 12ha vineyard and olive grove purchased in 1996, with 0.4ha of merlot and 5ha of olive trees. The olive grove has been rehabilitated, and 2.1ha of shiraz, 1.2ha of merlot and a small patch of viognier have been established. Wines made from estate-grown grapes are released under the Robert Johnson label; these are supplemented by Alan &amp; Veitch wines made from grapes purchased from the Sam Virgara vineyard in the Adelaide Hills, and named after Robert Johnsons parents. Exports to the UK and the US.
