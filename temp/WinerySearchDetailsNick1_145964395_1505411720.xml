            Owner Derek Freeman has planted pinot noir, and is the personal full-time viticulturist, helped out during peak periods by a part-time employee. It may not seem much, but successfully growing pinot noir (or any other variety, for that matter) in Tasmania requires an enormous degree of attention to debudding, leaf plucking, wire raising and (in the winter months) pruning. Not surprisingly, Freeman says he has no plans to extend the vineyard at the moment.
