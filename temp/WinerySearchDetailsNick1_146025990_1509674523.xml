            In 2011 the winery, built in 1998 at a cost of more than $33 million, was in mothballs. But it was then acquired by a family consortium from Melbourne and rapidly brought back into production, processing 8000 tonnes in the 11 vintage (notwithstanding the problems of that year), destined for sale in both Australia and China initially. A local winemaking team has been put in charge, and the business is apparently linked to a major liquor producer and distributor in Australia providing a range of fruit-flavoured ciders. Exports to all major markets.
