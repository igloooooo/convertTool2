            The Catalano family purchased the Shenton Ridge property in the Jindong area of Margaret River in 2002. The choice lay between extracting the gravel-rich soils or planting a vineyard; the coin came down on the side of a vineyard, and vines (predominantly shiraz, chardonnay and merlot) were planted. Andrea Catalano is now the sole owner and manager of the vineyard.
