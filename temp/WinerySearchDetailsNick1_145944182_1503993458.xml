            One of the most historic properties in the Hunter Valley, set in a particularly beautiful location and with a very attractive cellar door, has been owned by Brian Agnew and family since 2004. The wines are made from estate-grown grapes, the lions share to shiraz, the remainder (in descending order) to semillon, malbec, verdelho, tempranillo, merlot, cabernet sauvignon, muscat and traminer; the vines were planted between the 1970s and 90s. More recently, a small McLaren Vale vineyard of 3.45 ha, planted to merlot and shiraz, was acquired. Exports to Canada, China and NZ.
