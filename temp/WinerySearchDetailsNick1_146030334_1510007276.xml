            Peter and Ann Wormalds dream of owning a vineyard in Mudgee came true when they purchased a property in Eurunderee Lane which had an 1870s house and soil that seemed suited to viticulture. But it also involved Peter spending six years part-time studying for his degree in viticulture (while working full-time) and Ann going back into a pharmacy shop after many years in the pharmaceutical industry. Perseverance has seen the successful establishment of 4.4ha of chardonnay and 4ha of shiraz on the estate. The cellar door, which opened in 2004, was made in part from the sections of the old house removed for the extension.
