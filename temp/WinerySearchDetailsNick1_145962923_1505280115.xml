            The Currans story is a familiar one. In 1997 Chris and Sue Curran planted 4ha of shiraz for sale to large wineries, but after two years of production (2000 and 01) their grapes were suddenly no longer required, notwithstanding the great vintage. The only solution was to find a winemaker who was in tune with their organic approach to viticulture; and duly retained Glenn Olsen. Their success has encouraged the Currans to plant an additional 0.25ha of durif and 1ha of viognier. Exports to the US.
