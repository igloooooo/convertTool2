            Kevin and Julie Bate have progressively established over 5ha of vineyard (2ha cabernet sauvignon, 1.6 shiraz, 0.5 merlot and 0.5 each of semillon and sauvignon blanc). The first commercial crop came in 2001, but tiny makes in 99 (Cabernet Shiraz) and 00 (Cabernet Sauvignon) won bronze medals at the Bathurst Cool Climate Wine Show.
