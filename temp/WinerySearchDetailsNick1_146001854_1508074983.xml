            The story of Arran Murphy has a fairytale ring to it. He began as an unqualified cellarhand at Tahbilk in 2000, and in 03 was offered the opportunity of a traineeship at Plunkett Wines. He began studying wine production, and in 04 received a scholarship that enabled him to do a harvest in the Sonoma Valley. Since 00 he had been making small batches of wine by collecting grapes from the end of rows picked by mechanical harvesters, using chicken wire as a destemmer, and using a three-generations-old basket press. In 04 he decided to purchase a few tonnes of grapes and make his first commercial wine. With next to no capital, he was unable to afford any new oak, so experimented with inner staves, chips and oak cubes. This resulted in three batches of wine in 04, which he called Hazel Shiraz, honouring his late grandmother Hazel Murphy, who had encouraged him to aim high.
