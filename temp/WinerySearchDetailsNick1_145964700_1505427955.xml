            Marg and David Gillespie both had agricultural or viticultural backgrounds before moving to Qld (Marg worked with Bullers Wines). In 1994 they began a search for agriculturally viable land with permanent water to start their own vineyard, and the property at Traveston provided the answer. Planting began in 1997 with chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, followed a year later by merlot and sauvignon blanc; a total of 2ha is now under vine.
