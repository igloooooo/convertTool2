            In 1991 Neil Prentice and family established their Moondarra Vineyard in Gippsland, eventually focusing on the 2ha of low-yielding pinot noir. Subsequently, they began planting their Hollys Garden vineyard at Whitlands in the King Valley, where they have 8ha of pinot gris and pinot noir. It is from this vineyard that all but 200 dozen of their wines come, sold under the Hollys Garden label. Exports to the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, Korea and Japan.
