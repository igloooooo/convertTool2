            Glastonbury Estate is situated in the hills of Glastonbury, high up in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, 50 mins from Noosa. It is the vision of managing director Steve Davoren, who (in typical Qld tradition) has established a combined wine and tourism venture. Chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon have been established on terraces cut into the hillsides, with further plantings underway.
