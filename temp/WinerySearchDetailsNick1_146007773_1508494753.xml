            Pemberley Farms is owned by David and Monica Radomiljac. Known as Rado for short, David has been a vineyard manager in Pemberton for several decades. As well as 14ha of vineyards owned by Pemberley Farms, Rado manages a 35ha vineyard at Forest View, with all of the grapes sold to Houghton and Willow Bridge Estate, and a 60ha vineyard at Big Tree contracted to Goundrey and Houghton. The Big Tree Vineyard was awarded the Best New Vineyard Development at the WA Wine Industry Awards 2005. The focused marketing in Broome of the relatively small amount of Pemberley Farms wines made by David Crawford (at Willow Bridge) is interesting: it is called the Broome Wine Collection, because David and Monica realised the wines being offered to these major tourist destinations had no link whatsoever with the regions. Since you cant grow grapes and make wine in Broome or the Kimberleys, they have done the next best thing through wine names and label designs.
