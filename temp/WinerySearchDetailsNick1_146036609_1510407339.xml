            Sam Vogel is a graduate in wine science from CSU, and worked in Margaret River and the Rhne Valley before joining Scott Ireland at Provenance Wines in Geelong. The eponymous winemaking venture focuses on cool climate shiraz using both Old and New World practices; he generally includes 20% whole bunches, believing this provides greater complexity, both in terms of structure and aromas.
