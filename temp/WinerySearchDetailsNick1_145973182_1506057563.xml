            When Lee Gillespies great-grandfather applied for his land title in 1856, he had already established a vineyard on the property (in 1853). A survey plan of 1857 shows the cultivation paddocks, one marked the Grape Paddock, and a few of the original grapevines have survived in the garden that abuts the National Trust Heritage homestead. In 1986 Lee and husband John decided on a modest diversification of their sheep, wool and cereal crop farm, and began the establishment of vineyards (cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir). 2003 commemorated 150 years of family ownership of the property.
