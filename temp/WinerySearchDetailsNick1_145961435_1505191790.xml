            Cooper Burns is the winemaking partnership of Mark Cooper and Russell Burns. It is a virtual winery focusing on small-batch, handmade wine from the Barossa Valley (grapes are sourced from Kalimna, Koonunga Hill and Moppa at the northern end of the valley). In 2006 production was increased to add a Shiraz Viognier and Grenache to the existing single-vineyard Shiraz. Exports to the US and Hong Kong.
