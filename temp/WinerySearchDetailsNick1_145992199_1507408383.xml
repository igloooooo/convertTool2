            Owners Lucinda and Andrew Gromotka planted their vineyard in 1990, the lions share to pinot noir, with 0.4ha each of shiraz and chardonnay. It is an east-facing block, the soil ancient volcanic deep red clay loam, with buckshot giving a high ironstone content. Andrew is both winemaker and viticulturist, describing himself as vigneron.
