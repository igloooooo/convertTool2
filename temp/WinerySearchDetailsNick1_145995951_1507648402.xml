            Ross and Helen Camfield planted their vineyard in 2002; the plantings were of shiraz (4.5ha), with cuttings taken from the Old Block at Bests, sangiovese (2ha) and pinot gris (3.5ha). Further plantings of merlot and tempranillo will follow at the end of 2009. The vines are grafted onto drought-resistant rootstocks, and the soil is grey-brown loamy sand with small granules of quartz stone on top of a red clay base. Until 2007 the wines were made by Dominique Portet, the Pinot Gris in a deliberate French style. Eighty per cent of the production is exported to  China.
