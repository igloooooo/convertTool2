            Established on one of the original Heathcote farming properties, Ladys Creek Vineyard is situated on the narrow Cambrian strip 11km north of the town. Adrian Munari has harnessed traditional winemaking practices with New World innovation to produce complex, fruit-driven wines that marry concentration and elegance. They are produced from estate plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and malbec. Exports to France, Denmark, Taiwan and China.
