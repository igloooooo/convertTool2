            In 1956 the Curtis family emigrated from Italy to Australia, and purchased its first vineyard land from one Clarence William Torrens Rivers. They renamed it Clarence Hill. Further land was acquired in the 1980s and â€™90s, establishing the Landcross Estate and California Rise vineyards, which, together with Clarence Hill, now have over 100 ha in production. Claudio Curtis (who has a science degree from Adelaide University) manages wine production and sales. Wines are released under the Clarence Hill, Landcross Estate and Martins Road labels. Exports to the UK, the US, The Netherlands and China.
