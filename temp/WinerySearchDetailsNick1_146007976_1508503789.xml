            This is the birthplace of Penfolds, established by Dr Christopher Rawson Penfold in 1844; his house is still part of the immaculately maintained property. It includes 5.2ha of precious shiraz used to make Magill Estate; the original and subsequent winery buildings, most still in operation or in museum condition; and the much-acclaimed Magill Restaurant, with panoramic views of the city,a great wine list and fine dining. All this is a 20 min drive from Adelaides CBD. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
