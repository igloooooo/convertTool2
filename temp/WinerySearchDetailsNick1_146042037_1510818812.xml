            Woongooroo Estate was established by primary schoolteachers Phil and Gail Close, who planted 0.5ha each of shiraz, semillon and chardonnay, and 0.25ha each of cabernet franc and verdelho, together with a commercial olive grove. It is part of the a new, albeit unofficial, Qld wine region known as the Somerset Valleys Grape &amp; Wine Producers Association, more generically falling within the Queensland Coastal Hinterland.
