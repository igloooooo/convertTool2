            Dental surgeon Ian Hanson planted his first vines in the late 1960s, close to the junction of the Yarra and Plenty rivers; in 83 those plantings were extended (by 3000 vines), and in 88 the Tarrahill property at Yarra Glen was established with a further 4 ha. The vineyards were devastated by the Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009, with only 1.2ha of cabernet franc and 0.4ha of cabernet sauvignon remaining. Tragic. Exports to the UK.
