            The Scotts Brook winery at Boyup Brook (equidistant between the Margaret River and Great Southern regions) has been developed by local schoolteachers Brian Walker and wife Kerry. There are 15ha of vineyards, but the majority of the production is sold to other winemakers, with limited quantities being contract-made.
