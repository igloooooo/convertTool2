            A youthful John Curnow began his career over 30 years ago buying and selling wines from all over the world. He then moved to Coca-Cola, becoming a senior executive or CEO in Hungary, the Czech Republic, NZ, the US and Australia. In 1996 he and wife Sue began Eighteen Forty-Seven, with two vineyards planted to shiraz, semillon, petit verdot and a little sauvignon blanc. The name Eighteen Forty-Seven is derived from the date of the original land grant on the property, which also was the site of the first commercial winery in the Barossa Valley. Until 2002 the grapes were sold to other Barossa Valley producers, but in that vintage the first wines were made. Exports to the US, Germany, Hong Kong, Vietnam and China.
