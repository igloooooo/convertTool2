            Danniel Amadio says he has followed in the footsteps of his Italian grandfather, selling wine from his cellar (cantina) direct to the consumer, cutting out wholesale and distribution. He also draws upon the business of his parents, built not in Italy, but in Australia. Amadio Wines has substantial vineyards, primarily in the Adelaide Hills, and also small parcels of contract-grown grapes from Clare Valley, McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek, covering just about every variety imaginable, and  naturally  with a very strong representation of Italian varieties. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Russia, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
