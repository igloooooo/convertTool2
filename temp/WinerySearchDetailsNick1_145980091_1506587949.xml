            This venture began in the late 1990s with the establishment of two vineyards at different locations in the Adelaide Hills. The Schoenthal Vineyard near Lobethal, at an elevation of 440500m, is planted primarily to sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, with smaller amounts of pinot noir and pinot gris. The Howard Vineyard is at a lower elevation, and the slightly warmer site has been planted (in descending order) to sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, semillon, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, viognier and cabernet franc. The substantial quantities of grapes not required for the Howard Vineyard label are sold to other winemakers. Exports to Hong Kong.
