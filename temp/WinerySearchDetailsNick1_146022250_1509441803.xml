            The Zapris family established Sir Paz Estate in 1997, planting just under 6ha of shiraz; the first release of 01 scored an emphatic gold medal at the Victorian Wines Show 03 as the highest scored entry. The success led to the planting of additional merlot, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc. It is not hard to see the anagrammatic derivation of the name. Exports to the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, United Arab Emirates and China.
