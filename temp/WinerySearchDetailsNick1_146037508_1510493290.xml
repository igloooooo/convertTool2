            Jennifer Baird and Peter Cameron purchased this remarkable property in 2002. Waterton Hall was built in the 1850s and modified extensively by well-known neo-gothic architect Alexander North in 1910. The property was owned by the Catholic church from 194996, variously used as a school, a boys home and a retreat. Following its sale the new owners planted 1ha of riesling at the end of the 90s. Jennifer and Peter extended the vineyard with 1ha of shiraz, electing to sell the riesling until 2006, when part was first made under the Waterton label. The plans are to use the existing buildings to provide a restaurant, accommodation and function facilities. Last years rating is maintained in the absence of a representative submission of its wines (one wine tasted at the Tasmanian Wine Show) in the 2013 edition.
