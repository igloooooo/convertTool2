            In 2009 the American owner and founder of Clos du Val (Napa Valley), Taltarni and Clover Hill (see separate entry) brought the management of these three businesses and Domaine de Nizas (Languedoc) under the one roof. The group is known as Goelet Wine Estates. Taltarni is the largest of the Australian ventures, its estate vineyards of great value and underpinning the substantial annual production. There is no question it makes good red wines, but given its region, the climate/terroir of its very large estate vineyards and the age of the vines, one has the constantly nagging feeling it ought to do better. Exports to all major markets.
