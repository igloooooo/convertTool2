            Cheryl Hines and Anthony Fergusson purchased Conihfer Park in 2003. It is part agistment farm and part vineyard, with 1.5ha of pinot noir and 1ha of chardonnay planted in 1996. The vines were in full bearing, and the grapes were sold to other wineries in the region. One tonne of pinot was retained and vinified for Myola Vineyard in 2005, followed by another small make in 07. The partners hope to eventually make some pinot each year, with chardonnay part of the mix. They made a sparkling wine for their daughters wedding, and intend to follow this up with limited releases in the years to come.
