            The Ireland family planted cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot and verdelho vines in 1997, with follow-on plantings of muscat, viognier and pinot gris. Red grapes not required for cellar door production are sold to local wine producers, and some white grapes are purchased from other Granite Belt producers. It is somehow appropriate that the accommodation by Harrington Glen is in fact a former Victorian Railways train carriage now embedded within the accommodation building.
