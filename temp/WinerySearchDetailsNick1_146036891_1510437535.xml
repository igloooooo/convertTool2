            Laurie and Margaret White have planted 10.25ha of vines on their 130-year-old family property in a move to diversify. Until 1994 the winery was known as Redhill Estate. Over half the annual production from the 10.25ha vineyard (cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, verdelho, chenin blanc, merlot and shiraz) is sold.
