            Few would know the challenges facing small, start-up wineries better than Philip Murphy. After the sale of his very substantial retail wine business to Coles, he and wife Jennifer decided to have a seachange and move down to the Mornington Peninsula. He then happened to meet Kevin Bell of Hurley Vineyard, who gave him the confidence to enrol in wine science at CSU in 2003. The Murphys built a new house, incorporating a winery and cellar door underneath. They planted chardonnay and pinot noir (the latter French clones and MV6), and the first experimental vintage followed in 07; the 08 was a big step forward says Philip, and hes not wrong. And, of course, he has completely circumvented the sale challenges with the tiny make (although it may be expanded) by selling most of the wine through the mailing list and small amounts through the Pinot Shop in Launceston, the Prince Wine Store and Como Wines &amp; Spirits in Melbourne.
