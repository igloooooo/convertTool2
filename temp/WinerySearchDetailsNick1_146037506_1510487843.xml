            Peter Cumming, with more than two decades of winemaking under his belt, has quietly built on the reputation of Water Wheel year by year. The winery is owned by the Cumming family, which has farmed in the Bendigo region for 50+ years, with horticulture and viticulture special areas of interest. Over half the vineyard area is planted to shiraz (75ha), followed by chardonnay, sauvignon blanc (15ha each), cabernet sauvignon, malbec (10ha each), and smaller plantings of petit verdot, semillon, roussanne and grenache. The wines are of remarkably consistent quality and modest prices. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Singapore, Thailand, China and NZ.
