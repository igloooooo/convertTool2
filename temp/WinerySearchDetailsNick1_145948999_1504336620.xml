            Owned by Angelo Aquaro, who acquired the business from the founding Bianchet family. One of the most unusual wines from the winery is Verduzzo Gold, a late-harvest sweet white wine made from the Italian grape variety. While the production is small, the annual crush is substantially larger, with a number of small Yarra Valley wineries having their wines made at Bianchet (Small Batch Winemakers). Exports to Canada.
