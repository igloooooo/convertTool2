            Jennifer and John Nagorcka have developed Hochkirch in response to the very cool climate: growing season temperatures are similar to those in Burgundy. A high-density planting pattern was implemented, with a low fruiting wire taking advantage of soil warmth in the growing season, and the focus was placed on pinot noir (5ha), with lesser quantities of riesling, chardonnay, semillon and shiraz. The Nagorckas have moved to certified biodynamic viticulture: vines are not irrigated, and no synthetic fungicides, pesticides or fertilisers are used. Jennifer and John, together with Jennifers sister Dianne, are also owners of the Tarrington label. Exports to Japan.
