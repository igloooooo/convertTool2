            Don, David and Katrina MacLennan have planted sauvignon blanc, semillon, chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, and are making the wines in a winery constructed with sawdust blocks and ironbark posts. The business was previously called Orange Country Wines; one suspects the ambiguity of the name led to the change.
