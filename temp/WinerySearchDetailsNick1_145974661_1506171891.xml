            The business is owned by Robert Walters, well known for his role with Bibendum Wine Co., which (inter alia) imports fine wines from various parts of Europe, with France to the fore. He has imported the wines of Alain Graillot, one of the superstars of the northern Rhne Valley (in Crozes-Hermitage) for many years. The two have become good friends during that time, but in 2010 that friendship took a new turn. For a number of years prior, Robert had been making small quantities of Heathcote shiraz with guidance from Sandro Mosele from the Colbinabbin area, but was not satisfied with the results. Having visited the vineyard from which the grapes had been supplied, Alain was sufficiently convinced of the potential to become winemaker/consultant for the business, which is owned and financed by Robert. There will be three wines made each year for the foreseeable future, the first simply labelled Syrah, the second Project Syrah No. 2 and the third (of varying amounts) sold as bulk wine.
