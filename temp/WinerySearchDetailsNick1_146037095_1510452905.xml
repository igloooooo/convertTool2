            Peter and Liz Rushen acquired Waratah Hills Vineyard in 2001; it had been established with advice from Phillip Jones (of Bass Phillip) on a northeast slope in a beautifully domed valley formed by Battery Creek. The vines (2.8ha of pinot noir and 1.2ha of chardonnay) have developed slowly, the first vintage coming in 04, but Phillip Jones has had no involvement in the winemaking since the Rushens purchased the vineyard. There was yet another change of ownership, with Neil and Judy Travers the purchasers in 11. </description></item></WineryInfoDetails></extraction>
