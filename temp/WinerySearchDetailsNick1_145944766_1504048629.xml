            Mal Baisden and Lel Doon purchased the 20-ha Back Pocket property in 1997, which had long been used for fruit growing, with a small patch of shiraz planted in the early â€™80s. It was progressively expanded to its present level: shiraz (0.7 ha), tempranillo (0.5 ha), fiano and graciano (0.4 ha each). The Old Savina Shiraz recognises the efforts of the Savina family, who planted the shiraz; Arabia, a budget-priced shiraz; Castanets, 100% tempranillo; and Pickpocket, a rose produced from the juice run-off to concentrate the shiraz.
