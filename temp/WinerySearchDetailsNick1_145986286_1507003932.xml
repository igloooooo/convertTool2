            Kiss &amp; Tell is the virtual winery operation of Keiran Spencer and partner Renae Joyce. Through Keirans association with Bidgeebong Wines he and Renae were offered the opportunity to purchase small quantities of grapes from Tumbarumba (chardonnay) and Gundagai (shiraz). They say their plan is to produce classy wines at an affordable price and have some fun doing it. Mostly sold through word of mouth and a small number of select outlets.
