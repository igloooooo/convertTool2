            Fourth-generation farmers Richard and Alice Tallis planted their vineyard on the red volcanic loam soils of their traditional farming property, bringing back viticulture to the Dookie area?after its absence for almost 100 years. In the late 1800s Dookie flourished with expansive vineyards, and at its peak produced one-third of Victorias wine. Annual wine balls were held on the Tallis property in a vast, and still undiscovered, cellar buried beneath the Dookie Hills. Tallis uses a tread lightly approach in the vineyard, avoiding sprays and using mulching and composting, with minimum intervention in the winery. An eco-sensitive cellar door constructed from straw bales grown on the property, plus recycled and sustainable building materials, and with an energy-sensitive layout, opened in 2012.  Exports to Fiji and China.
