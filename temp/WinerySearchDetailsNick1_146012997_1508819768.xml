            The name comes from the three owners of this venture: Ringland, Bruce and Johnstone. They have 1ha each of old, dry-grown grenache and mourvedre, and have quietly gone about their work over the past 15 years, secure in the knowledge that there would always be more demand than supply. Their stated aim is to work with this great fruit and make wines that are driven by the vineyard with little influence of oak. Microscopic quantities are released in Sydney through Ultimo Wines, in Melbourne through Rathdowne Cellars, in Perth through Chateau Gilford and in Adelaide East End, Edinburgh and Melbourne Street Cellars.
