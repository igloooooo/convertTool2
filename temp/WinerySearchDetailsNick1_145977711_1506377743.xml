            This is very much the part-time business of winemaker Tom Robinson and sales manager Ashley Coats. In a potential demarcation dispute, Tom Robinson won the Gourmet Traveller Wine Magazine/Wine Communicators Australia New Wine Writer Award 12, and holds a Masters degree in French literature. Each of them has a part-time teaching job at Mercedes College, Tom lecturing in French, Ashley head of the Arts Faculty. Tom's journey through wine is a prodigious one, covering the US for many years, and more recently, Australia. With a production of 250 dozen, they have travelled below the Halliday radar up to this point, but have been making wines under the Head in the Clouds banner since 2008.
