            Ben Haines graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1999 with a degree in viticulture, waiting a couple of years (immersing himself in music) before focusing on his career. An early interest in terroir led to a deliberate choice of diverse regions, including the Yarra Valley, McLaren Vale, Adelaide Hills,Langhorne Creek,Tasmania and Central Victoria,as well as time in the US and France. Most recently, he worked at Mitchelton as senior winemaker, and in 2008 won The Wine Society Young Winemaker of the Year Award.
