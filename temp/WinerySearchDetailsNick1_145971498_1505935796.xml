            Greg Gallagher was senior winemaker at Taltarni for 20 years, working with Dominique Portet. He began planning a change at much the same time as did Portet, and, together with wife Libby, started establishing a small vineyard at Murrumbateman in 1995, now planted to 1ha each of chardonnay and shiraz. Between 1999 and 2004 Greg was winemaker at Charles Sturt University, and now acts as both winemaker and consultant for a dozen or so wineries in or near to the Canberra District.
