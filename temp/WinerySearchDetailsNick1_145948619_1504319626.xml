            John and Steven Bergamin have established a 23-ha vineyard, planted to 5 ha each of pinot gris, chardonnay, merlot and shiraz, 3 ha of sauvignon blanc. These supply both the varietal releases (Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot and Shiraz) but also the production of Grappa (using merlot, shiraz and purchased nebbiolo). They also produce Vinocotto, a slow reduction of sauvignon blanc juice to the point of syrup. Something different, indeed.
