            Don and Judy McCallum planted the firstha of vineyard in 1995, followed by a further 3.5ha in 1996, focusing on shiraz and chardonnay. Their son Stuart built many unusual but practicable objects dotted around the property. In 2002 Maryanne Pidcock and Peter Eaton purchased the property, with business as usual thereafter.
