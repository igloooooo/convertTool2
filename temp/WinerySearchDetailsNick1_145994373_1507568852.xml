            Sailing master Rowland Short, having run one of Australias most successful sailing schools, decided (in his words) to brave the choppy waters of the Australian wine industry by establishing Maximus Wines in partnership with wife Shelley. They purchased an already-planted shiraz vineyard, and built a cellar door using sandstone blocks, with western red cedar doors and windows. It is built into the side of a hill, and has a barrel store underneath for maturing cask and bottled wine. Grapes are purchased from other vineyards in McLaren Vale, and the wines are contract-made by local winemaker Scott Rawlinson.
