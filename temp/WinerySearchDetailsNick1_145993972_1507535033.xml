            With plantings commencing in 1993, Marri Wood Park has 2.2ha of chenin blanc, 1.6ha of sauvignon blanc, 1.5ha of cabernet sauvignon, with semillon, malbec and merlot making up the total; part of the grape production is sold to other makers. The budget-priced Guinea Run range takes its name from the guinea fowl which are permanent vineyard residents, busily eating the grasshoppers, weevils and bugs that cluster around the base of the vines, thus reducing the need for pesticides. The vineyard is certified In Conversion Biodynamic and since the 2009 vintage, the wines have been biodynamic.
