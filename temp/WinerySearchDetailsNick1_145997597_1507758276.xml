            Owner Mauro Travaglione says Mirabella is the name of a city in Campania in southern Italy, where the first Italian immigrants to farm this land came from. His vineyard plantings cover shiraz (including some old vines), chardonnay, semillon and sauvignon blanc. Part of the grape production is sold, the remainder vinified under the Mirabella Vineyards label.
