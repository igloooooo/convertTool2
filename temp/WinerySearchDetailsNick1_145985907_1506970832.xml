            Owner and winemaker Keith Salter had 29 years experience working in the wine industry when he established Kindred Spirit Wines in 2006. That experience was gained in Tasmania, Geelong, Swan Hill and even a stint in the UK teaching a motley group of wine students the finer points of winemaking, says Salter. These days he not only operates the Bianchet winery and vineyard, but is a partner in Small Batch Winemakers, a contract winemaking business also located at Bianchet. He buys grapes from various parts of the Yarra Valley for Kindred Spirits Steel Breeze label, but the frost of 2007 severely cut production; drought and frost permitting, the range of Sauvignon Blanc and Rose (from the Yarra Valley) and Viognier (Strathbogie Ranges) will be completed by the addition of a Yarra Valley Shiraz.
