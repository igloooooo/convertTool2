            John and Leonie Salmons have one of the older and more interesting small vineyards on the Mornington Peninsula, on a steep north-facing slope of a small valley in the Red Hill area. The area takes its name from the ancient red basalt soils. Five clones of pinot noir are planted (MV6, D5V12, G5V15, 115 and D2V5) totalling 1.2 ha, and a few hundred vines each of pinot meunier and pinot gris.
