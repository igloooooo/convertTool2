            Ducketts Mill is a twin operation with Denmark Farmhouse Cheese, both owned and operated by Ross and Dallas Lewis. They have the only cheese factory in the Great Southern region, and rely on James Kellie to make the wines from the extensive estate plantings (riesling, chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon blanc, merlot, cabernet franc, ruby cabernet and cabernet sauvignon). Some of the grapes are sold, some made into Riesling, Semillon Sauvignon Blanc, Late Harvest Riesling, Rose, Merlot and Three Cabernets and sold at low prices. The handmade cheeses make an even wider choice.
