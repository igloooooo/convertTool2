            Mark and Louisa Sims have two vineyards, one with 1ha of shiraz on their property in Cowra, the other of 4ha in shiraz the Hilltops region. Mark Sims has been a vineyard manager and viticulturist for 25 years after graduating from CSU (as it is now called) in 1983; from an early career managing vineyards in Germany, he came back to Australia and to the Hunter Valley and Cowra at various times. As a quite separate venture to Kiola, in 2002 he formed a partnership to develop 100ha of vineyards in the Canowindra area.
