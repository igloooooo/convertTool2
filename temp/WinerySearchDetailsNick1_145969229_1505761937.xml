            This is an extended family-owned business, dating back to 1982 when John and Janette Carruthers established the vineyard. In 2004 their daughter Janel built the winery, and the business moved into its second phase. All have experience in various aspects of the wine industry, from logistics and planning through to wine science and winemaking. Indeed, their combined experience covers every base in the most impressive manner imaginable. The estate vineyards are planted to chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, sangiovese and viognier.
