            While Coriole was not established until 1967, the cellar door and gardens date back to 1860, when the original farm houses that now constitute the cellar door were built. The oldest shiraz forming part of the estate plantings dates back to 1917, and since 85, Coriole has been an Australian pioneer of sangiovese and  more recently  the Italian white variety fiano, plus barbera and nero dAvola have joined the fold. Shiraz has 65% of the plantings, and it is for this variety that Coriole is best known, led in turn by the super-premium Lloyd Reserve, the flagship. Exports to all major markets.
