            Pharmacist Howard Matthews and family purchased the former Woodend Winery in 2000, with 1.8ha of chardonnay and pinot noir (and a small amount of cabernet franc) dating back to the mid 1980s. Subsequently, the cabernet franc has been grafted over to pinot noir (with a mix of four clones), and the chardonnay now totals 1ha. After working with next-door neighbour Ken Murchison of Portree Wines for two years gaining winemaking experience, Howard has been making the wines since 2003.
