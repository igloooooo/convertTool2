            David and Margaret Graf planted an experimental plot of 320 shiraz and riesling vines in the back garden of their 0.7ha house property in 1997 and 98. The first wine was produced in 2000, and in 01 the Grafs successfully applied for an off-license, the first in the region. In the meantime they have planted a further 1.4ha on a 4ha property directly across the road.
