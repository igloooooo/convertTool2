            The Ganfield family has established its 4.5ha vineyard and winery in a pristine area of the Darling Range. There is a four-generation family history of farming, and the development has been planned with the maximum possible respect for the environment. Chardonnay, Verdelho, Shiraz, Cabernet Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon are produced.
