            Tashinga Estates has a number of investments in the Tasmanian wine industry, having been a partner in Bream Creek Vineyard since 1995 as well as establishing the 3ha Tashinga Vineyard in 90, and the 14ha Meehans Vineyard in 99. The Meehans Vineyard has now been sold, so future releases will continue to be limited. The bulk of the grapes from both vineyards are sold to Hardys/Bay of Fires, but at some future time, as the vines gain maturity, small parcels will be contract-made for commercial release under the Tashinga label.
