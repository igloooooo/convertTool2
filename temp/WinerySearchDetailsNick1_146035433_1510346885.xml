            The Bottin family migrated to Australia in 1954 from Treviso in northern Italy, where they were grapegrowers. The family began growing grapes in McLaren Vale in 1970, focusing on mainstream varieties for sale to wineries in the region. When son Paolo and wife Maria made a trip back to Italy in 1998, they were inspired to do more, and, says Paolo, My love for barbera and sangiovese was sealed during a vintage in Pavia. I came straight home to plant both varieties in our family plot. My father was finally happy! They now trade under the catchy phrase Italian Vines, Australian Wines, and in the short time they have been producing their Italian varietals, have won a gold medal, two silvers and a bronze at the Australian Alternative Wine Show.
