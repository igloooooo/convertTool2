            The story behind Velo Wines is fascinating, wheels within wheels. The 0.9ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha of pinot noir of the Legana Vineyard were planted in 1966 by Graham Wiltshire, legitimately described as one of the three great pioneers of the Tasmanian wine industry. Micheal and Mary Wilson returned to Tasmania in 91 after living in Italy and France for a decade. Micheal had been an Olympic cyclist and joined the professional ranks, racing in all of the major European events. Imbued with a love of wine and food, they spent seven long hard years in the restaurant game. Somehow, Micheal found time to become a qualified viticulturist, and was vineyard manager for Moorilla Estate based at St Matthias; Mary spent five years working in wine wholesaling for leading distributors. In 2001 they purchased the Legana Vineyard, planted so long ago, and they have since painstakingly rehabilitated the 40-year-old vines. They have also built a small winery where Micheal makes the red wines, and Julian Alcorso makes the white wines.
