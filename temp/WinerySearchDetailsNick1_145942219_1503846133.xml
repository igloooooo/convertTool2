            The Ashby family have market garden and landscaping backgrounds, and the establishment of a small vineyard on the block of land in which their house sits seemed a natural thing to do. What is unusual is the density of the planting, the utilisation of a lyre trellis, and the permanent netting erected around the vineyard ?? this means they do not speak of acres or ha, but of the 2500 vines planted, and of the production as 8400 bottles.
