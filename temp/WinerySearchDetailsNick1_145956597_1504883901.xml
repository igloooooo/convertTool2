            The Halcyon Vineyard, as it is known locally, was established in 1978 with the planting of a little under 5ha of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, chardonnay and semillon. Graham and Sue Connell purchased the property in 1991, increasing the plantings to 8ha with more pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Exports to Hong Kong.
