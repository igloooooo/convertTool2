            While driving through the Chittering Valley one Sunday with his daughter Angela, reminiscing about the times he had spent there with his father Hartley, Bernie Stephens saw a For Sale sign on the property, and later that day the contract was signed. Planting of vines began, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz released in 2003. They form part of the Generations Series, recognising the involvement of three generations of the family. The major part of the crop goes to Western Range Wines; the remainder is made for the Hartley Estate label. Extensive landscaping has been carried out throughout the property, featuring sculptures, wild flowers and a lake. Exports to China.
