            This is one of several winemaking ventures owned by Mike and Sally Calneggia, who have had a major role in the viticultural development of Margaret River over the past decade. Alexandra Bridge has had various changes of ownership and direction, production now downsized from 9000 dozen, the grapes contract-grown.
