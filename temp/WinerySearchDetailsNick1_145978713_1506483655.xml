            A beautifully located vineyard and winery at 1000m on a ridge overlooking the Ballandean township and the Severn River Valley. The granite boulderstrewn hills mean that the 70ha property only provides 2ha of vineyard, in turn divided into six different blocks planted to shiraz and merlot. The business is owned by a group of Brisbane wine enthusiasts and Jim Barnes, who runs a contract winemaking business as well as making the Hidden Creek wines.
