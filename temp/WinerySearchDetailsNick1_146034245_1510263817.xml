            A significant part of the viticultural scene in the Upper Hunter Valley, with over 75ha of vineyards, involving a total investment of around $7 million. Part of the fruit is sold under long-term contracts,and part is made for the expanding winemaking and marketing operations of Two Rivers, the chief brand of Inglewood Vineyards. The emphasis is on Chardonnay and Semillon, and the wines have been medal winners at the Hunter Valley Wine Show. It is also a partner in the Tulloch business, together with the Tulloch and Angove families, and supplies much of the grapes for the Tulloch label. A contemporary cellar door adds significantly to the appeal of the Upper Hunter Valley as a wine-tourist destination.
