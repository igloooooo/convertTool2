            Dentist turned vigneron and winemaker Joe Ceravolo, and wife Heather, have been producing single vineyard wines from their 23ha estate on the Adelaide Plains since 1999. Significant wine show success, particularly with Shiraz, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Sangiovese, has added to the reputation of their brand. Their son Antony, with wife Fiona, is now working with them to take their family business into the next generation. The Ceravolos have also established vineyards (6.5ha) around their home in the Adelaide Hills, focusing on cooler-climate Italian varieties such as primitivo, piccolit, pinot grigio, dolcetto, barbera and cortese. Wines are released under Ceravolo, St Andrews Estate and export-only Red Earth labels. Exports to all major markets.
