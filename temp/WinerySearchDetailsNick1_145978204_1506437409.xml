            The Holmes familys background runs from Samuel Henry Holmes (whose parents William Henry and Penelope Jane Holmes are co-owners of the property) to Samuel Henrys great-great-grandparents, whose son (and his great-grandfather) Henry Holmes was born en route to Australia from England. A further distinction is that the property owned by the Holmes family today was first planted by the Henschke family in the 1860s. The label denotes the division of opinion between Bill and Penny (as they are known) on the merits of viticulture on the one hand and White Suffolk sheep on the other; shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, grenache and tempranillo are on one side of the property, sheep on the other (held at bay by a fence). Exports to the US.
