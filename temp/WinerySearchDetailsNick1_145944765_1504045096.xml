            Bruno Tassone migrated from Italy when he was eight, and grew up watching his father carry on the Italian tradition of making wine for home consumption. Bruno, a lawyer, followed the same path before purchasing a 35ha property with wife Jennifer. Here they have planted 2ha each of riesling, semillon, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, 1ha of chenin blanc and 0.5ha of nebbiolo, plus a more recent planting of sangiovese. Exports to Canada.
