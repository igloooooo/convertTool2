            While the establishment date of the winery is given as 2003, Dino and Veronica Sigismondi purchased their first 12ha vineyard in 1989, and have progressively increased to the present level of shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and petit verdot. They have two labels: Southern Secret, which is made onsite from start to finish, and a second label, Kuali Cliff, using estate grapes but contract-made offsite. The Southern Secret Petit Verdot has had great success, winning gold medals at successive Riverland wine shows (with successive vintages) and numerous enthusiastic press reviews. They have had several overseas marketing trips which has taught them the hazards and difficulties of exporting, but without dimming their hopes and expectations. It is open once a year from 8 am to 12 pm for the Around the Region festival day.
