            This is the retirement venture of Peter and Maureen Long, who acquired a 16ha bare paddock in 1997, with the Warby Ranges behind and a panoramic view of the Australian Alps. The following year they established equal amounts of shiraz and merlot, and a grape purchase contract with Baileys of Glenrowan. Since 2003, production has been split between sales to other producers, and wine under the Granite Range Estate label. The modern building complex comprises the Longs house, cellar door, barrel store and self-contained accommodation. Exports to Singapore and Hong Kong.
