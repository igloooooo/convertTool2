            Richard and Susan Bradley purchased the substantial Calais Estate in 2000. Long-serving winemaker Adrian Sheridan continues his role, and the estate offers a wide range of facilities for visitors, ranging from private function rooms to picnic spots, to an undercover outdoor entertaining area.
