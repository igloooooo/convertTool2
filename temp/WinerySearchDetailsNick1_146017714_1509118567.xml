            Its far from clear how Doug Govan, owner of the Victory Hotel (circa 1858), came to choose the name Rudderless for his vineyard adjacent to the hotel. The vineyard, divided between shiraz, graciano, grenache, malbec, mataro and viognier, surrounds the hotel, which is situated in the foothills of the Southern Willunga Escarpment as it falls into the sea. He has retained Justin McNamee as contract winemaker and the wines have already had significant international success. Exports to the US.
