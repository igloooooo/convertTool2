            Terry and Rosemary Bennett planted their first 0.5ha of vines in 1994 on gentle slopes in the beautiful Huon Valley. Between 94 and 99 the plantings were increased to 3ha of pinot noir, 1.5ha of chardonnay and 0.5ha sylvaner. Home Hill has had great success with its exemplary Pinot Noir, a consistent wine show major award winner.
