            Diz and John Adams vineyard is at the head of the Kiewa Valley, looking out over the mountains of the area. It is on a northeast slope with a mixture of deep, red loam/clay and shallow red loam over ancient river stone soils, at an altitude of 365m. Over the years, the Shiraz has won many wine show medals, not surprising given the extensive Flying Winemaker experience of John Adams. Commencing in France in 2000, he has recently extended his consultancy work to Abruzzo, Italy and La Mancha, Spain. This comes in handy when, as in 2007, the Tawonga vintage was destroyed by bushfire smoke taint.
