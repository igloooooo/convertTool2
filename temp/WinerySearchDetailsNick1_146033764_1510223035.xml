            When Dan and Margaret Mary Zaal purchased the Tulley Wells vineyard in 1998, they came with a background of owning and running restaurants. The vineyard had 0.75ha of (then) 17-year-old grenache, and in 1999 they extended the plantings with 1ha of shiraz. In 2002 they planted 350 grenache vines, grown in the traditional bush vine fashion, without any trellising.
