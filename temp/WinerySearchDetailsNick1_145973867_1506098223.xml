            Charlie Scalzi arrived in Australia with his parents in 1960, the family settling in Adelaide. His final education was mechanical engineering, and at the age of 24 he established Monza Motors, specialising in Italian cars such as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. In 1998, having followed in the footsteps of grandfather and father with home winemaking, he purchased a 40ha property near Lyndoch, planting 4.5ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, 2ha of merlot and 1ha of chardonnay. Most of the grapes are taken by Dorrien Estate, with a small amount retained for the Gods Hill label. Exports to China.
