            The original 2ha shiraz vineyard was planted in the mid-1960s by the late Tom Connor. Tom was renowned for his development of Australian farming machinery, having invented the worlds first pick-up baler and post hole digger. He had visions of perfecting the automatic grape harvester and set about planting the vineyard in preparation for his retirement. Unfortunately ill health prevented his dreams from coming to fruition, and Tom passed away in 1982, the vines left to run wild. Ross (Toms nephew) and Robyn Lougoon purchased the property in 1985, and in 92 resuscitated and expanded the vineyard with new plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Originally content to sell the grapes to other winemakers, Connor Park produced its first wines in 1993. Exports to the US, Canada and Asia.
