            Ian and Gertrud Adams began the establishment of their vineyard with the planting of cabernet sauvignon in 1996, shiraz in 97, and viognier in 2001, a total of 3 ha; subsequent grafting of part of the cabernet sauvignon to merlot, cabernet franc and malbec has not increased the area. It is very much a family affair, winemaking done by their chef-aspiring vigneron son, Mark. Situated on the snow road to Mt Beauty and Falls Creek running through the Kiewa Valley, it is beautifully located. Mark handles private functions at Trudis Kitchen Door.
