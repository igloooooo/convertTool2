            Adelaide Hills residents Chris and Anne Thomas love for Flinders Ranges Shiraz, Clare and Eden Valley Rieslings, and SA Cabernet Sauvignon encouraged Chris, a semi-retired engineer, to complete postgraduate oenology studies at Adelaide University, graduating in 2002. Vintages in cooler parts of California and the 2004 vintage in Tumbarumba led to a decision to move from the Adelaide Hills to Tumbarumba in 05. Until Chris arrival there was no winery or professional winemaker in the region, an earlier sparkling wine facility ceasing to operate many years ago. Five local grapegrowers banded together to own and operate a grape-processing facility where Chris makes the Kosciusko wines, and is a contract maker for others, including the owners of the facility.
