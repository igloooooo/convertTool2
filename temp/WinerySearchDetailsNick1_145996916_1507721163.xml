            This is a book about wine, not polo, but it so happens that Millamolong Estate has been the centrepiece of Australian polo for over 80 years. For an even longer period, generations of James Ashton (differentiated by their middle name) have been at the forefront of a dynasty to make Rawhide or McLeods Daughters seem tame. The vineyard includes chardonnay, riesling, cabernet, shiraz and merlot. Exports to the UK.
