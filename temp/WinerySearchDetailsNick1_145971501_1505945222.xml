            Gapsted is the major brand of the Victorian Alps Winery, which started life (and continues) as large-scale contract winemaking facilities. However, the quality of the wines made for its own brand (Gapsted) has led to the expansion of production not only under that label, but under a raft of cheaper, subsidiary labels including Tobacco Road, Coldstone, Buckland Gap, Snowy Creek, Waterstone Bridge, and doubtless others in the pipeline. Its vineyards extend across the Alpine Valleys and (mostly) the King Valley. Its vineyard holdings have increased from 166ha to the present level, the winemaking team expanded with the arrival of Tony Pla Bou. Exports to the UK, Germany, Denmark, China and Japan.
