            Hope Estate has, in the manner of a hermit crab, cast off its older, smaller shell, and moved into a resplendent new home. New in the sense for Hope Estate, for it is in fact the former Rothbury Estate winery. The timing was serendipitous; the giant miner Xstrata found a rich coal seam under the Saxonvale winery previously owned by Michael Hope, and made an offer he couldnt refuse. It will be interesting to watch the future development of Hope Estate, made more complex by the acquisition of quality vineyards in WA. Plantings are, in descending order, shiraz (30ha), merlot (13ha), chardonnay (10ha), semillon, cabernet sauvignon (5ha each ) and verdelho (3.5ha). Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
