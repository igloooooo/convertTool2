            Garry Capelli and Leanne Rogers purchased the property in 2005 and have since created the Lake House Denmark. They have restructured the vineyard to grow varieties suited to the climate: chardonnay, pinot noir, semillon and sauvignon blanc, incorporating biodynamic principles. They also control a couple of small family-owned vineyards in Frankland River and Mount Barker, with a similar ethos. Wines are released in three tiers: the flagship Premium Reserve range, the Postcard Series and the quirky He Said, She Said easy-drinking wines. The combined cellar door, restaurant and gourmet food emporium is a popular destination.
