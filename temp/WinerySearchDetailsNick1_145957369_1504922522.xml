            Channybearup has been established by a small group of Perth businessmen who have been responsible for the establishment of 62ha of vineyards. The leading varieties are chardonnay, merlot, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, with lesser amounts of verdelho and sauvignon blanc. While principally established as a grape supplier to other makers, the amount of wine being vinified for Channybearup has increased significantly. Exports to the US.
