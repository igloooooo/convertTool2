            Owner/winemaker Guy Wagner has built the scope of his business over a period of 10 years, the greater expansion starting in 200708. He now makes wines for 17 small vineyards in Northern Tasmania in addition to his own wines; the 2008 crush was over 220 tonnes, with just one cellar hand to assist him. At the end of that year his partnership in the Rosevears winery ended, and a new winery was constructed prior to the 09 vintage at Invermay, well inside the city of Launceston. The cellar door at this location has glass walls, allowing visitors to observe the workings of a small winery. Retail distribution in Tas,Vic, NSW and ACT. Exports to the US.
