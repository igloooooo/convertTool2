            Kithbrook Estate (formerly Gemleigh Meadows) has two vineyards at Strathbogie: the first and larger is at an altitude of 480500m, the second is higher up the hillside at the 560580m contour lines. By far the most important part of the business is grapegrowing for others, coming from 37.41ha of sauvignon blanc, 27.41ha of merlot, 14.48ha of pinot noir and 13.71ha of chardonnay, plus a dash of shiraz. Some of the wines have scored well at the Strathbogie Ranges Wine Show.
