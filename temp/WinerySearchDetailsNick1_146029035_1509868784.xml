            The vineyard is situated on the western side of Mt Camel at Toolleen, on the red Cambrian soil that has made Heathcote one of the foremost regions in Australia for the production of Shiraz (Tellurian means of the earth). Planning is underway for the construction of a winery on the Toolleen vineyard site, and viticultural consultant Tim Brown not only supervises the Tellurian estate plantings, but also works closely with the growers of grapes purchased under contract for Tellurian. Further Rhne red and white varieties have been planted on the Tellurian property in 2011.
