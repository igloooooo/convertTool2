            Bob and Margit Beischer purchased the well-established vineyard (and surrounding land) in 1998, initially selling the grapes to Bendigo TAFE, where Bob was undertaking viticultural and winemaking studies, thus seeing their grapes vinified. The long-term plan was to build their own winery, and this was completed for the 2006 vintage. Prolonged drought has kept the yields very low. The estate-grown wines are released under the Bullock Creek Vineyard label; the Bullock Creek Wines label is for those made incorporating some locally grown grapes.
