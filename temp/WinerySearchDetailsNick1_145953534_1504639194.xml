            The derivation of the name is even more direct and simple than you might imagine: the owners are Stuart and Liz Brumby, who decided to plant grapes for supply to others before moving to having an increasing portion of their production from the shiraz (4ha), chardonnay and durif (3ha each) vinified under their own label.
