            Fyffe Field has been established by Graeme and Liz Diamond near the Murray River in a mudbrick and leadlight tasting room opposite a historic homestead. They have 2ha of shiraz, 1.5ha merlot, and 1ha each of semillon, verdelho, and cabernet sauvignon, and 0.5ha petit verdot. A highlight is the collection of ornamental pigs, a display set up long before Babe was born.
