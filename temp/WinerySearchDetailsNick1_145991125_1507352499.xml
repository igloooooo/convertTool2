            Raymond Neindorf and Louise Spangler run a small eco-business taking full advantage of the national heritage-listed wetlands reserves; Loch Luna Eco-Stay is part of the world network of biosphere reserves. A cottage for 2-3 people is 300m from the homestead/cellar door. The wines come from 10 ha of vineyards, and are made in limited quantities.
