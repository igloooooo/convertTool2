            Alon Arbel came to WA from Israel in search of strong, easterly sea breezes to power his passion for windsurfing. Here he met wife-to-be, Jodi, and, after working overseas and travelling, they returned to Perth. A year out from completing a degree in engineering, Alon switched to Curtin Universitys oenology and viticulture course, which he duly completed. Entirely fortuitously, Jodis parents, Frank and Lois, discovered a 10ha property on the foothills of the Darling Scarp, with plantings dating back to 1966. The property was purchased and a winery erected post-haste, and has flourished. Since then they have grafted the plantings to an ultra-eclectic mix, which includes the Japanese variety kyoho. In late 2010 leading WA journalist Ray Jordan bestowed on Bella Ridge the title of Small Producer of the Year in his annual book on the wines of WA. Exports to Singapore and Hong Kong.
