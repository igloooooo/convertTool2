            Richmond Estate featured in a number of books I wrote between 1979 and 84, as then-proprietor Barry Bracken (a Sydney orthopaedic surgeon) was making excellent Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. However, he sold the property in 1984, and it went through several owners before being purchased by Monica and Tony Radanovic in 87. The Radanovics have restored the vineyard, which had been run-down in the years prior to their purchase, and while only 3ha are under vine, the vineyard is used by the University of Western Sydney as its field laboratory for undergraduate and wine production courses.
