            The first harvest from the Phillip Island Vineyard was marked in 1997, and the vineyard (sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir) is totally enclosed in the permanent netting, which acts both as a windbreak and protection against birds. The quality of the wines across the board make it clear that this is definitely not a tourist-trap cellar door; it is a serious producer of quality wine. In 2009 Tim and Tricia OBrien purchased the winery and vineyard from founders David and Cathy Lance, but retained James Lance as winemaker.
