            Hendra Widjaja came to Australia from Indonesia to establish a vineyard and winery, and he initially chose the Yarra Valley for the first vineyard, thereafter establishing a larger one in Heathcote. The Yarra Valley vineyard has 62.4ha (pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay, sangiovese, pinot gris, mataro, petit verdot and viognier), the Heathcote vineyard 66.5ha (shiraz, nebbiolo, tempranillo, merlot, viognier and cabernet sauvignon). The wines are made at the Heathcote winery. While the major part of the production is exported, there are also direct sales in Australia. Wines are released under the Cahillton, White Box and Huma labels. Exports to Germany, The Netherlands, Indonesia, Malaysia, Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and NZ.
