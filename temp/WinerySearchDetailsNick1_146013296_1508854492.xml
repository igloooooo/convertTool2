            The Redbank brand was for decades the umbrella for Neill and Sally Robb’s Sally’s Paddock. In 2005 Hill Smith Family Vineyards acquired the Redbank brand from the Robbs, leaving them with the Redbank winery and Sally’s Paddock label. RedbankVictoria purchases grapes from the King Valley, Whitlands, Beechworth and the Ovens Valley (among other vineyards sources). Exports to all major markets.
