            Sam Dardha arrived in Australia 35 years ago with wine in his veins from growing up in the Macedonia/Northern Greece/Albania sector of Europe. He and wife Mary purchased the property in 1995, planting 1ha each of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha each of shiraz and pinot noir in 97. The first commercial vintage was in 2004.
