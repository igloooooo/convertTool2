            After almost 20 years slowly and carefully building the business, based on the classic Clare Valley varieties of riesling, semillon, grenache, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, Tim Adams and Pam Goldsack decided to increase their production from 35 000 to 50 000 dozen. Like their move to a total reliance on screwcaps, there is nothing unexpected in that. However, the make-up of the new plantings is anything but usual: they will give Adams more than 10ha of tempranillo and pinot gris, and about 3.5ha of viognier, in each case with a very clear idea about the style of wine to be produced. In 2009 the business took a giant step forward with the acquisition of the 80ha Leasingham Rogers Vineyard from CWA for a reported price of $850 000, followed in 11 by the purchase of the Leasingham winery and winemaking equipment (for less than replacement cost). The only asset retained by Accolade Wines (the new owner of CWA) is the Leasingham brand name. The winery will become a major contract winemaking facility for the region. Exports to all major markets.
