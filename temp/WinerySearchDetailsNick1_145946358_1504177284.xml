            Bob Furbank and wife Julie Chitty are both CSIRO plant biologists: he is a biochemist (physiologist) and she is a specialist in plant tissue culture. In 1997 they acquired the 120ha property forming part of historic Jeir Station, and have since planted 15 grape varieties. The most significant plantings are to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot, riesling and chardonnay, the Josephs coat completed with micro quantities of other varieties.
