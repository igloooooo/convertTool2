            In 2009 Rob and Mary Loughan, owners of the adjoining Erudgere since 04, acquired Thistle Hill from Lesley Robertson.Thistle Hill was already certified organic (by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia [NASAA], which means no weedicides, insecticides or synthetic fertilisers), and Erudgere became certified organic in July 10. From the 11 vintage, all of the Erudgere and Thistle Hill wines will be sold under the Thistle Hill label. The appointment of Michael Slater as winemaker paid immediate dividends, the 09 Riesling winning multiple trophies. It is fascinating that, at a time of global warming, Thistle Hill and Robert Stein should be producing Rieslings of the highest quality. Exports to Mongolia and China.
