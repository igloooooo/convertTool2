            For some time now Simon Gilbert has devoted himself to his consultancy and wine brokering business Wineworks of Australia. As that business has grown, and with the sale of the Prince Hill winery to the Watson Wine Group, Simon has returned to the winery wearing his Wineworks of Australia hat, overseeing the winemaking of the estate-grown grapes, all of which will be exported. Separate from his consultancy business, he has established gilbert by Simon Gilbert, and also makes the wines for this label at the same winery. Grapes are sourced from premium locations across Australia, and not restricted to the same localities each year. Distribution is limited to specialist wine retailers and restaurants.
