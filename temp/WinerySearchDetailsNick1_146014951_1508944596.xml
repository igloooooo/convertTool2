            Rigel Wine Company is owned by Dr Damian and Sue Ireland, and Michael and Mary Calman; the Irelands own the 2-ha Mornington Peninsula vineyard at Shoreham, which provides the grapes for the super-premium Rigel label. The second property is at Tocumwal and has 80 ha of vines with 6 km of Murray River frontage. Most of these grapes are sold to other makers, but part of the production is vinified for both the local and export markets.
