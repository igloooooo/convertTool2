            Famous Melbourne restaurateur Rinaldo (Ronnie) Di Stasio bought a virgin bushland 32ha hillside block in the Yarra Valley, adjacent to the Warramate Flora and Fauna Reserve, in 1994. He has established equal quantities of pinot noir and chardonnay, put in roads and dams, built a substantial house, and also an Allan Powelldesigned monastery, complete with art gallery and tree-filled courtyard sitting like a church on top of the hill. Production has never been large; the wines are sold through Cafe Di Stasio in St Kilda, a Melbourne icon. Exports to the UK.
