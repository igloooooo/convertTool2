            A survivor of another era, when literally dozens of such wineries plied their business in the Swan Valley. It still enjoys a strong local trade, selling much of its wine in fill-your-own containers and 2-litre flagons, with lesser quantities sold by the bottle. Ownership has passed to Velko and Helen Bakranich, the next generation of the family.
