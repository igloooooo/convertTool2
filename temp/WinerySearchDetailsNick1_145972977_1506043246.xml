            Damien Tscharke grew up in the Barossa Valley among the vineyards at Seppeltsfield and Marananga. In 2001 he began the production of Glaymond, four estate-grown wines based on what he calls the classic varieties (following the trend of having catchy, snappy names), followed by wines under the Tscharke brand using the alternative varieties of tempranillo, graciano, zinfandel, montepulciano and savagnin. Like the Glaymond wines, these are estate-grown, albeit in very limited quantities. Exports to the US, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Israel, Indonesia, Singapore and China.
