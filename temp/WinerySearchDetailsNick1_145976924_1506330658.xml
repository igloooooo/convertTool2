            Under the direction of principal owners Karl and Julie Hillier, Harris River Estate has rapidly increased in size since its establishment in 2000. The estate vineyards are planted to verdelho, viognier, chardonnay, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, and all of the wines are estate-grown and made, and offer excellent value. Exports to Singapore.
