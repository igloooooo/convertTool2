            Little Bridge is a partnership between long-term friends John Leyshon, Rowland Clark, John Jefferey and Steve Dowton. There are 2ha of chardonnay, pinot noir, riesling and merlot planted at Folly Run; 2ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, sangiovese, cabernet franc and malbec at Mallaluka; and 1.5ha of riesling, chardonnay and mourvedre at Brooks Creek. Canberra Winemakers makes the white wines, Lark Hill the Pinot Noir, and Mallaluka the other reds. Steve purchased Brooks Creek Vineyard in 2009 (largely derelict, and being rehabilitated), and it is here that the Little Bridge cellar door is situated. Exports to Singapore and China.
