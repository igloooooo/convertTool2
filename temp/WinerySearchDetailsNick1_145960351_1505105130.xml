            Clos Clare was acquired by the Barry family in 2008. Riesling continues to be made from the 2ha unirrigated section of the original Florita Vineyard (the major part of that vineyard was already in Barry ownership) and newly introduced red wines are coming from a 49-year-old vineyard beside the Armagh site. Exports to the UK.
