            John and Marcia Skinner planted 2.5ha of pinot noir and 0.5ha of riesling in 2000. It is very much a hands-on operation, the only concession being the enlistment of Rob Drew (from an adjoining property) to help John with the winemaking. When the first vintage (2004) was reaching the stage of being bottled and labelled, the Skinners could not come up with a name and asked their daughter Claire. Easy, she said. Youve got two kids already; considering the care taken and time spent at the farm, its your third child.
