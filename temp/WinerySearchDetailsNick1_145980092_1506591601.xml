            Tony and Mary Betteridge migrated to Australia in 2002 with the dual objectives of finding an attractive place to live and a worthwhile occupation for their retirement. They say The beautiful view we chose came with the vineyard, thus determining our occupation. Within a year we had mastered the tractor, pruned our first vines, chosen a name, logo and label  planted a second vineyard, built a rustic cellar door, and added considerably more knowledge of wine culture to our limited experience of simply enjoying Cape (South African) wines. Tony is 83 years young; he and Mary do all the vineyard work, enlisting family and friends for picking.
