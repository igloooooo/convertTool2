            Ann Dewar and Ian Parmenter (celebrated television food presenter) planted 1 ha of chardonnay cuttings (from Cape Mentelle) at their property on the north bank of the Margaret River. Their first wine was produced in 1998, and the style of each succeeding vintage has been remarkably consistent.
