            Warren and Stephanie Gelland moved from Sydney to Mudgee in 1998 to start a family with room to move. They had no background in viticulture, but friends who had previously made the same move and established a vineyard suggested that the Gellands follow suit, which they duly did by planting 4ha of cabernet sauvignon and 2ha of chardonnay. More recently they have purchased small parcels of shiraz and viognier from Mudgee vineyards to add a Cabernet Shiraz, Viognier Chardonnay and Cabernet Rose to the portfolio.
