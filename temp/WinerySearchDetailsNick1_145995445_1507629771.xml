            Notwithstanding his 20-year career in finance, Mark Phillips also had six years of tertiary qualifications in horticulture when he and wife Jane began the search for a Southern Highlands site suited to premium grapegrowing and olive cultivation. In 1998 they bought 42ha of farm land on Wombeyan Caves Road, just out of Mittagong. They have now established 5.5ha of pinot noir and pinot gris on deep, fertile soils at the front of the property. In addition, a 1.5ha olive grove has been planted, which provides the backdrop for the cellar door and caf.
