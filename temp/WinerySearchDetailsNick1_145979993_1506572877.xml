            Previously known first as Echuca Estate Wines, and then by its corporate owner, New Glory Pty Ltd. Since taking the management reins, industry veteran Don Buchanan has focused on retrellising and training the 38ha vineyard planted to verdelho, viognier, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, durif, sangiovese and petit verdot. The wines are released in two price levels: Charlottes Farm the entry point, and the Hopwood Single Vineyard premium range. Exports to the UK, Canada, Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong.
