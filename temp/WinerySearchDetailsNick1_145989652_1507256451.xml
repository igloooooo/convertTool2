            Brian and Helen Lightfoot have established pinot noir, shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, the lions share to pinot noir and shiraz. The soil bears a striking resemblance to that of Coonawarra, with terra rossa over limestone. The vines are irrigated courtesy of a licence allowing the Lightfoots to pump water from the Mitchell River, and most of the grapes are sold (as originally planned) to other Vic winemakers. With the arrival of Alastair Butt (formerly of Brokenwood and Seville Estate), supported by son Tom, production has increased, and may well rise further. Second son Rob has also come on board, bringing 10 years experience in sales and marketing.
