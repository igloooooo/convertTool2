            Pauline and Peter Bicknell purchased the 60ha property on which their vineyard now stands in 1993, at which time it was part of a larger grazing property. The first vines were planted in 94, and include shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot. In the first few years the grapes were sold, but since 2001 part of the production has been used to make the impressively rich and powerful wines. The grapes are hand-picked, fermented in open vats with hand-plunging, and matured for 18 months in American oak. Exports to Canada, Singapore and China.
