            After closing their operation in the Hunter Valley, David Lowe and Jane Wilson have set up a new business in Mudgee, using grapes from various vineyards in the region. The cellar door is in the heritage winery at Fairview (formerly known as Platt's), which has been returned to working order, once more housing tanks, oak casks and barrels.
