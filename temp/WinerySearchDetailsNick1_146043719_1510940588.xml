            Former East Doncaster orchardist Alan Johns acquired the 40ha Yeringa Vineyard property in 1980; the property had originally been planted by the Deschamps family in the mid-19th century and known as Yeringa Cellars. From orchardist to vigneron is not a large step, and he intuitively chose optimum vine spacing and trellis systems, with a relatively low yield per ha. The wines are largely sold through Vic restaurants and the cellar door. All are made onsite by Alan. Exports to the US, Canada and Asia.
