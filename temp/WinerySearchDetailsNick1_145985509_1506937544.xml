            Kenred is the venture of Fay and Ken Keech. The vineyard is planted solely to shiraz, with the single clone, SA 1654. The northwest boundary features a pine plantation, and a short walk through that plantation brings you to an ornamental lake; alternatively barbecue and picnic facilities are available adjacent to the winery.
