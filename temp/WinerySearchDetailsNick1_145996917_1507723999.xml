            The Millbrook Estate vineyards produces between 400 dozen (in a dry year) and 800 dozen (in a good year). Interestingly, the vineyard is on a geological fault line, and is in fact an uplifted ancient creek bed. Plantings include chardonnay, shiraz and sauvignon blanc. A distillery is also in operation. The wine list is nothing if not interesting, with conventional table wines followed by fortified and specialty wines including Chilli Wine and Lemonella; next are wood aged brandies and, finally, elaborately packaged fruit liqueur wines.
