            Gaye and Matt Ramunno operate Witchmount Estate in conjunction with its Italian restaurant and function rooms. The vineyard is planted (in descending order) to shiraz (12ha), cabernet sauvignon (6ha) and chardonnay (2ha), with lesser amounts of sauvignon blanc, pinot gris, merlot, tempranillo and barbera. The quality of the wines has been consistent, the prices very modest. Exports to Canada, Denmark and Singapore.
