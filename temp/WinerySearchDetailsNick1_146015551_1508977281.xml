            Peter and Jenny Inglese began the establishment of 10ha of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon in 1995. They also built a bluestone homestead and cellar door, incorporating 100-year-old reclaimed timber. The site has 360-degree views of the Yarra Valley and surrounding mountains, and antipasto platters are available for those who wish to stay a little longer and absorb the beauty of the valley.
