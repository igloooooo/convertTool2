            Cassegrain has continued to evolve and develop. It still draws on the original Hastings River vineyard of 4.9 ha, the most important varieties being semillon, verdelho and chambourcin, with pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon making up the numbers. However, Cassegrain now part-owns and manages Richfield Vineyard (see separate entry) in the New England region, with 30ha of chardonnay, verdelho, semillon, shiraz, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and ruby cabernet. These estate vineyards are supplemented by grapes purchased from Tumbarumba, Orange and the Hunter Valley.  Exports to the UK, the US, and other major markets.
