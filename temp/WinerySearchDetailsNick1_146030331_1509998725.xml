            The major investment and principal business of The Vineyards Estate is the 8-studio-suite guest house sitting among the 5ha of vines. There is also the high quality Splash restaurant offering the prospect of all-inclusive gourmet weekends for couples. The estate wines are sold through the restaurant and guest house, with other local wines available in the restaurant.
