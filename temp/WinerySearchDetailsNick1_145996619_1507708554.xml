            Andrew and Belle Close purchased 180ha of what was part of the large Mihi Station sheep and cattle property in 2001. Situated at an elevation of 1000m, the first plantings in 03 (sauvignon blanc, viognier, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and merlot) performed well, with the first vintage in 06. Since then, there have been further plantings of sauvignon blanc, with removal of the cabernet sauvignon making way for yet more sauvignon blanc. Further plantings of pinot noir and viognier are planned.
