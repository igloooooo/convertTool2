            Starvedog Lane came into existence as part of a joint venture with John and Helen Edwards of Ravenswood Lane, who had established 28 ha of vineyards in 1993. Part of that production was sold to the joint venture for the Starvedog Lane brand, part reserved for release under the Ravenswood Lane brand, which morphed into The Lane (see separate entry). Confusing, but the situation is now much simpler, as the Edwards and Hardys have severed all commercial ties. The Starvedog Lane brand is wholly owned by Accolade and relies on contract-grown grapes from growers in the Adelaide Hills.
