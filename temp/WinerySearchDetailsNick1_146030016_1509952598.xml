            An interesting, indeed exotic, tourism complex owned and run by two Dutch families, Hennie and Pleun Hitzert and Ron and Sue Terwijn. It features The Lily Railway Station restaurant, on the reconstructed 1924 Gnowangerup Railway Station, and a windmill. The windmill was completed in 2003 with the help of a group of millwrights from Schiedam in The Netherlands; a 3-tonne heavy grinding stone now produces flour (available from The Lily and outlets around WA). Less exotic, perhaps, is the 3ha vineyard planted to chenin blanc, chardonnay, grenache, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc.
