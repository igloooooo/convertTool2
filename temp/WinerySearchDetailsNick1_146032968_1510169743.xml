            Peter and Tina Sexton planted 5ha of vineyard in the early 1990s; pinot noir and chardonnay are the principal varieties, with a small amount of cabernet sauvignon and merlot. While on a north-facing hill, with heavy black soil over a calcareous lime base, it has never been an easy site; frost has claimed some vintages, and lack of heat others.
