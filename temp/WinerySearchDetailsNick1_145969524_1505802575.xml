            Claude and Paula Ferraris purchased their property in the Hunter Valley in 2000, guided from the outset by Rhys Eather of Meerea Park. They were also following in the footsteps of their grandparents and parents, who had arrived in Australia at the turn of last century and became pioneers of the sugar industry in Far North Qld. Moving from sugar cane to vines, and to the establishment of shiraz on sandy loam with a light clay loam topsoil, has paid dividends.
