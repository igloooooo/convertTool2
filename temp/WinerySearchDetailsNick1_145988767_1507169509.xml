            Colin and Bronwyn Cooter (who are also part of the Lengs &amp; Cooter business) are the driving force behind Antechamber Bay Wines. The wines are in fact labelled and branded Lashmar; the Kangaroo Island Cabernet Sauvignon comes from vines planted in 1991 on the Lashmar family property, which is on the extreme eastern end of Kangaroo Island overlooking Antechamber Bay. The Three Valleys and Sisters wines (from other regions,including McLaren Vale and Adelaide Hills) give the business added volume. Exports to Singapore and Japan.
