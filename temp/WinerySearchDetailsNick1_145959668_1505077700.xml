            An affiliate of Kaesler Wines, its primary focus is on exports to China, Singapore and Hong Kong. Its vines are predominantly given over to shiraz (15ha) and cabernet sauvignon (9.5ha). It also has 3.8ha of riesling and 2.2ha of semillon, but no chardonnay, which is presumably purchased from other Clare Valley growers.
