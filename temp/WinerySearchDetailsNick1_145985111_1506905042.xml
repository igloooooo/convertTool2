            A traditional winery with a rich history and just over 20ha of priceless old vines; while the white wines have been variable, the red wines and fortified wines can be very good. Of particular interest is Block 6 Shiraz, made from 100-year-old vines; both vines and wines are going from strength to strength. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and NZ.
