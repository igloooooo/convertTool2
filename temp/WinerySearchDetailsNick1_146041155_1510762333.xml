            Witches Falls is the venture of Jon and Kim Heslop. Jon has a deep interest in experimenting with progressive vinification methods in order to achieve exceptional and interesting results. He has a degree in applied science (oenology) from CSU, and experience working in the Barossa and Hunter valleys as well as at Domaine Chantel Lescure, Burgundy, and a Napa-based wine grower in California. Witches Falls has a small estate planting of durif, with the majority of wines being made from contract-grown grapes sourced predominantly from the Granite Belt. One of the most consistently good producers in the Granite Belt. Exports to the UK, Malaysia and China.
