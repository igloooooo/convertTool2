            Four members of the Maher family have established Two Tails Wines, with an exotic mix of gewurztraminer, semillon, chardonnay, verdelho, pinot noir, shiraz, chambourcin, ruby cabernet and villard blanc on their 2ha vineyard. The wines are made onsite; the cellar door offers barbecue/picnic facilities.
