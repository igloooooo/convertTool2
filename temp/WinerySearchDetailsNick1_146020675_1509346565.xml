            Mike Sharman pioneered one of the more interesting wine regions of Tasmania,not far south of Launceston but with a distinctly warmer climate than (say) Pipers Brook. Ideal north-facing slopes are home to the vineyard (planted to pinot noir, chardonnay, riesling, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and malbec). This additional warmth gives the red wines greater body than most Tasmanian counterparts.
