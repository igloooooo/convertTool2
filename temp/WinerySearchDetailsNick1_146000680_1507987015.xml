            Founded by the late David Wynn for the benefit of winemaker son Adam, Mountadam was (somewhat surprisingly) purchased by Cape Mentelle (doubtless under the direction of Met Hennessy Wine Estates) in 2000. Rather less surprising was its sale in 05 to Adelaide businessman David Brown, who has extensive interests in the Padthaway region. Con Moshos (long-serving senior winemaker at Petaluma) has made a significant impact in lifting the quality of the wines. One should hope so, because Con eats (well, almost), drinks and sleeps Mountadam. Exports to the UK, France, Switzerland, Poland and Hong Kong.
