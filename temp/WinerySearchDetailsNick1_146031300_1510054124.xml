            The Kerr family has done much with Tibooburra since they began assembling their 1000ha property in 1967. They have established a champion Angus herd, planted a vineyard in 96 on elevated northern and northwest slopes, established a truffiere in 2001 to supply Japanese and northern hemisphere restaurants with black truffles, and launched the Tibooburra Wines label in 02. Four generations have been, or are, involved in the business. Most of the grapes are sold. Plantings (in descending order) are chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir shiraz and merlot, and the quality of the early releases is all one could possibly ask for.
