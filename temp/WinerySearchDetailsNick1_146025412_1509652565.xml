            Jonathan Hambrook purchased what he aptly named Stockmans Ridge in 2002. Situated 20km north of Bathurst at 900m above sea level, it has spectacular views to the south. Since it was acquired, barely a month has gone by without activities involving the Hambrook family. A cherry orchard was established, cattle grazing commenced, a 1 million litre dam completed, and sequential planting throughout 04 and 05 with shiraz, pinot gris, pinot noir and savagnin the varieties chosen. Over and above this, Jonathan has leased two vineyards in Orange planted to merlot, shiraz, pinot gris and sauvignon blanc. While he has no formal winemaking qualifications, he is able to draw on advice from David Lowe (Lowe Family Wines), Mark Renzaglia (Winburndale Wines) and Phil Kerney (Ross Hill).
