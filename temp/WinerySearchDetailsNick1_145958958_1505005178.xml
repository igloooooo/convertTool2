            A substantial vineyard that commenced in 1987, with an onsite winery constructed in 98, Chestnut Grove has come full circle from founder Vic Kordic and sons Paul and Mark, to Australian Wine Holdings in 2002, and back to the Kordics in 09 under the umbrella of Manjimup Wine Enterprises Pty Ltd. Mark is general manager of the wine business, the cellar door has reopened and Chestnut Grove has resumed exports, currently to the US and Canada.
