            Mongrel Creek is a small, family-owned vineyard situated on the outskirts of Dunsborough in Margaret River; the primary focus is on producing quality wine at an affordable price. The seemingly tranquil creek that first attracted owners Larry and Shirley Schoppe to the property became a raging torrent during winter for three years, regularly washing away access. A lone blackboy growing in the middle of the creek is still standing, the waters still ravage in winter, but the Schoppes believe they have finally defeated Mongrel Creek.
