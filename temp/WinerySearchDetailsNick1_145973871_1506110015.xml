            Golden Grove Estate was established by Mario and Sebastian Costanzo in 1946, producing stone fruits and table grapes for the fresh fruit market. The first wine grapes (shiraz) were planted in 1972, but it was not until 85, when ownership passed to son Sam and his wife Grace, that the use of the property began to change. In 1993 chardonnay and merlot joined the shiraz, followed by cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc and semillon. The baton has been passed down another generation to Ray Costanzo, who has lifted the quality of the wines remarkably, and has also planted tempranillo, durif, barbera, malbec, mourvedre, vermentino and nero dAvola. Its consistent wine show success over recent years with alternative varieties is impressive.
