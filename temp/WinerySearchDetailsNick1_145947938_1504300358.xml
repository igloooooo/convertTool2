            John and Margaret Struik have established their vineyard on either side of a significant bend in the Angas River that runs through the property, with cabernet sauvignon on one side and shiraz on the other. The name comes from the bend in question, which is indirectly responsible for the flood that occurs every 45 years. The Struiks have restored what was known as the Postmasters Residence to be their home. Exports to Hong Kong.
