            Graeme Miller is a Yarra Valley legend in his own lifetime, having established Chateau Yarrinya (now De Bortoli) in 1971, and as a virtual unknown winning the Jimmy Watson Trophy in 78 with the 77 Chateau Yarrinya Cabernet Sauvignon. He sold Chateau Yarrinya in 1986 and, together with wife Bernadette, established a vineyard that has steadily grown to over 30 ha, with chardonnay, pinot gris, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, carmenere, shiraz, pinot noir, sauvignon blanc, petit verdot and merlot. A significant part of the production is sold, but the opening of the winery in 2004, and a cellar door thereafter, has seen production increase. Exports to China.
