            The Roennfeldt family emigrated from Germany in 1849 and has been growing grapes in the Barossa Valley for five generations. The vineyards, currently owned by Brett and Ruth Roennfeldt, are mainly 1220 years old, with small sections of 50-year-old shiraz, mourvedre and grenache; 60% of the plantings are shiraz. The vineyard produces around 120 tonnes of grapes a year, almost all of which are sold to leading Barossa wineries. In 2005 5 tonnes of seven- and 12-year-old shiraz were vinified to make the first release under the Roennfeldt label, marketed as 2005 Genesis Barossa Shiraz. No wine was made in the excellent 2006 vintage because the Roennfeldts were waiting to see how the 05 would be received. When it was placed sixth out of the 416 entries in the Visy Great Australian Shiraz Challenge 07 they had their answer, and production promptly resumed. The wine will always be a single-vineyard, estate-grown shiraz. Exports to China.
