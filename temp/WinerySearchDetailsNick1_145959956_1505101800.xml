            The Cleveland homestead was built in 1889 in the style of a Gothic Revival manor house, but had been abandoned for 40 years when purchased by the Briens in 1983. It has since been restored and 3.8ha of surrounding vineyard established. In 2002 incoming owner, Grange Group of Conference Centres, initiated fast-track development of The Grange at Cleveland Winery, with 22 suites, plus a large conference room and facilities alongside a new winery.
