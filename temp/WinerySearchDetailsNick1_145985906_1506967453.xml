            The Kimbolton property originally formed part of the Potts Bleasdale estate; in 1946 it was acquired by Henry and Thelma Case, parents of the current owners, Len and wife Judy Case. Since that time the grapes from vineyard plantings of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, zinfandel and montepulciano have been sold to leading wineries. However, in 98 the decision was taken to retain a small amount of cabernet sauvignon and shiraz to supply the Kimbolton Wines label established in that year (the name comes from a medieval town in Bedfordshire, UK, from which some of Judys ancestors emigrated).
