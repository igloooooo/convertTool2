            Peter Hodge, Laurence Huck, Kevin Tangney and Alf Baker are the owners of Scalawag Wines, and have made a substantial investment in the large estate vineyard, planted to shiraz (20ha), cabernet sauvignon (18.7ha), chardonnay (11ha), merlot (7.3ha), sauvignon blanc (4.8ha) and riesling (3ha). The planting material came from the Forest Hill Vineyard, the oldest in the Mount Barker region. The Scalawag property has well-known vineyards on three sides, the Hay River and Yamballup Creek forming the southern boundary. Emphasis in the vineyard is on organic products, and minimum chemical use. The prices of the wines are mouth-watering. Exports to Indonesia and China.
