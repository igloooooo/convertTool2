            The Hamelin Bay vineyard was established by the Drake-Brockman family, pioneers of the region. Richard Drake-Brockmans great-grandmother, Grace Bussell, is famous for her courage when, in 1876 aged 16, she rescued survivors of a shipwreck not far from the mouth of the Margaret River. Exports to the UK, Canada, Malaysia and Singapore.
