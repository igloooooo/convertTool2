            Move over Treasury Estates vintrepreneurs, for Brad Hickey has come up with creator and vinitor to cover his role (together with partner Nicole Thorpe) in establishing Brash Higgins. The one thing rather less clearly explained is how you move from Brad Hickey, bypass vintrepeneur, and come up with vinitor. His varied background, including 10 years as head sommelier at some of the best New York restaurants, then a further 10 years of baking, brewing and travelling to the best-known wine regions of the world, may provide some clue. More tangibly, he planted 4ha of shiraz, 2ha of cabernet sauvignon, and recently grafted 1ha of shiraz to nero dAvola on his Omensetter Vineyard looking over the Willunga Escarpment and on to the Gulf of St Vincent. He has used his New York experience to set up distribution of the wine in the US.
