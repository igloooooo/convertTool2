            This brings together Jeremy Gordon, wife Daniela and business partner Peter Walsh. Jeremy had a winemaking career starting with Evans &amp; Tate and thereafter Houghton, before moving to the eastern states to broaden his winemaking experience. After several years, he returned to the west to co-found Flametree Wines in 2007. In its first year, Flametree was awarded six trophies and over 30 medals. Amelia Park has no vineyards of its own, but that has not stopped its rapid growth. Exports to the UK, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Korea, Macau, Indonesia, Japan and NZ.
