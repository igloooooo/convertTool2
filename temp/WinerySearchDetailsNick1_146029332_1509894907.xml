            It would be hard to imagine two better-credentialled owners than Xavier Bizot (son of the late Christian Bizot of Bollinger fame) and wife Lucy Croser (daughter of Brian and Ann Croser). Terre  terre, incidentally, is a French expression meaning down-to-earth. The wines are available through independent retailers and leading restaurants, but also direct from the winery. The close-planted vineyard is on a limestone ridge, adjacent to Tapanappas Whalebone Vineyard. The vineyard area has increased (3ha of cabernet sauvignon, 2ha of sauvignon blanc and 1ha each of cabernet franc and shiraz), with an additional 0.5ha pinot noir leased. This has led to a doubling of production. Exports to Hong Kong.
