            In 1999, Bruce and Marg Rossiter (in their words) left home in the city to begin a second career in the country. By 2001 they found their property in the Otway Ranges, built a house and planted their first vines, completing the plantings of pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and riesling over the ensuing years. They also grow blueberries, and operate in a chemical-free environment to the maximum extent possible. The name, incidentally, is a tribute to Margs three aunts, Peggie, Vera and Lil, and the berries are available from January to March each year.
