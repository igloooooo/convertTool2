            Nugan Estate arrived on the scene like a whirlwind. It is an offshoot of the Nugan Group headed by Michelle Nugan, inter alia the recipient of an Export Hero Award in 2000. In the mid 1990s the company began developing vineyards, and it is now a veritable giant, with five vineyards: Cookoothama (335ha),Talinga Park (115ha) and Manuka Grove (46ha) in the Riverina, Frascas Lane (100ha) in the King Valley and McLaren Parish (10ha) in McLaren Vale. In addition, it has contracts in place to buy 1000 tonnes of grapes per year from Coonawarra. It sells part of the production as grapes, part as bulk wine and part under the Cookoothama and Nugan Estate labels. Both brands are having considerable success in wine shows, large and small. Today the wine business is in the energetic hands of Matthew and Tiffany Nugan, Michelles children. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
