            Formerly Sand Hills Vineyard, Banderra Estate dates back to the 1920s, and the ownership of Jacques Jenet. The Salet family became owners a number of years ago and have re-established estate plantings of chardonnay, colombard, semillon, shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, with a little pinot noir and mataro. As well as at the historic cellar door, the wines will also be available at an outlet in the McFeeters Car Museum, Forbes.
