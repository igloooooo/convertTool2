            Given the tiny production, Milford is understandably not open to the public; the excellent Pinot Noir is quickly sold by word of mouth. The 150ha grazing property (the oldest Southdown sheep stud in Australia) has been in Charlie Lewiss family since 1830. Only 15 mins from Hobart, and with an absolute water frontage to the tidal estuary of the Coal River, it is a striking site. The vineyard is on a patch of 1.5 m-deep sand over a clay base with lots of lime impregnation.
