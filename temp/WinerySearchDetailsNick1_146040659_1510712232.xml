            In 1999 David and Caroline Picton-King decided to exchange living and working in Perth for grapegrowing and winemaking in Mount Barker. They began to convert desire into reality in 2000 when they purchased the property and planted 1ha of shiraz. In 01 and 03 they planted 2.4ha of chardonnay, and finally 1.3ha of cabernet sauvignon in 04, with soft organic management. They had been commuting from Perth every couple of weeks to plant and tend the vines up to 04 when they moved permanently to Mount Barker. The majority of the grapes are sold to other wineries in the district, with most wine sales through the cellar door and caf.
