            This impressive venture is owned and run by Shaun and Kassy Cassidy and John and Annette Cassidy. With the exception of Tempranillo and Gewurztraminer, all of the wines are estate-grown and made, all coming from the New England region. Sean also makes the wines for Thunder Ridge (see separate entry). The converted Cobb &amp; Co. stables on the property provide the cellar door and a function and wedding venue.
