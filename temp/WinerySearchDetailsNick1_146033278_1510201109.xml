            In 1982 David McGowan and wife Corinne purchased the 30ha property upon which Treeton Estate is established, planting the vineyard two years later (shiraz, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay). David has tried his hand at a lot of things in his life, and in the early years was working in Perth, which led to various setbacks for the vineyard. The wines are light and fresh, sometimes rather too much so. Exports to Southeast Asia and China.
