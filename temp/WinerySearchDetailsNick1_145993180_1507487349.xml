            Formerly Snowy River Winery, this is an operation which relies entirely on the substantial tourist trade passing through or near Berridale on the way to the Snowy Mountains. The product range is, to put it mildly, eclectic; all the wines are said to be made onsite, and the grapes for all the white varietals are estate-grown.
