            When I tasted this range of wines, I had never heard of the name and knew nothing about the origin of the wines. However, skilled winemaking was apparent in every wine, and it also seemed improbable that they could have been made from young vines. And, indeed, I subsequently learnt that the vineyard goes back as far as 1970, with some intervening plantings, although none in recent years. It was previously owned by the Gartelmann Estate, and was used in the production of their wine up to and including 2006. When Russell and Katrina Leslie purchased the vineyard, they found a toy tin soldier among the vines; it not only provided the name, but the striking label design and packaging. While Tin Soldier has had significant show success, the tasting notes make it clear I was, and am, particularly impressed by the range of wines.
