            The friendship of the Lanz and Thomson families stretches back 30 years, although it was the two (future) wives who first became friends through Rotary International in the 1970s. In their words Brian and Thomas came on the scene over the next few years, sharing stories and bottles of wine. One thing led to another, and in 1998 they began the establishment of the 15ha Outlook Vineyard and the 16.5ha Moolanda Vineyard, each planted predominantly to shiraz, each with around 2ha of mourvedre and viognier, splitting only with grenache (1.44ha) on Outlook and cabernet (3.25ha) on Moolanda. The lions share of the grapes is sold.
