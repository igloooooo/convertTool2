            Ian McLellan and family purchased Mansfield Wines from his cousin Peter Mansfield in late 1997. Before and after that time,the original plantings,which included chardonnay,frontignac, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and shiraz, were removed, to be replaced by a Josephs coat patchwork of savagnin, vermentino, petit manseng, parellada, tempranillo, touriga, zinfandel and tinta cao, supported by grenache, mourvedre and pedro ximinez. Souzao and carignan are more recent arrivals. The wines offer excellent value.
