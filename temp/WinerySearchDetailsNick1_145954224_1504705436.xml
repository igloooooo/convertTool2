            Shortly after Jo and Richard Cummins moved to Orange, they realised their property was ideal viticultural land. Planting began in 1996 with cabernet sauvignon, followed the next year by further blocks of cabernet and shiraz. The wines are sold by mail order and through select restaurants.
