            The Golden Ball vineyard is on one of the original land grants in the Beechworth region. The 2.4ha vineyard was planted by James and Janine McLaurin in 1996, mainly to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot, with lesser plantings of grenache and malbec. The wines are vinified separately and aged in one-third new French oak, the remainder 23 years old. The low yields result in intensely flavoured wines, which are to be found in a Whos Who of Melbournes best restaurants and a handful of local and Melbourne retailers, including Randalls at Albert Park. Exports to Singapore.
