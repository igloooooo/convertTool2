            Red Rock Winery has progressively established 10ha of sauvignon blanc, semillon, pinot noir and shiraz, and is a part-time occupation for Rohan Little. It takes its name from the now dormant Red Rock Volcano which created the lakes and craters of the Western District when it last erupted 8000 years ago.
