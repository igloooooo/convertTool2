            A combined vineyard and restaurant business, each set on outdoing the other, each with major accolades. Founder Neil Head taught himself winemaking, but in 2007 employed Liam Clarke (with a degree in viticulture and oenology), and a string of significant show successes for Verdelho,Viognier and Reserve Chardonnay has followed. Chesters Restaurant, originally set up by Paul Smith, was awarded Best Tourism Restaurant in 08 and Best Restaurant at a Winery  Perth and Surrounds 09, chef James Ward having taken over before those awards were gained. Exports to Japan.
