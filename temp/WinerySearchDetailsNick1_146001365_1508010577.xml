            Owner Lesley McGillivray was well ahead of her time when, in 1988, she planted two test rows of Italian varieties on rich volcanic soil near the foothills of Mt Franklin. The varieties to succeed best were dolcetto and pinot gris, and with family and friends she planted the first third of the vineyard with dolcetto and pinot gris in 2000. Since then, the vineyard has been completed, with more dolcetto, pinot gris and a little nebbiolo.
