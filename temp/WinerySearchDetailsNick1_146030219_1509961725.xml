            Adrian and Conna Kearton have established their vineyard in part on what was once the Mayday Hills lunatic asylum vegetable garden, and part in the township of Stanley, 9km southeast of Beechworth and at an elevation of 750m. It is hardly surprising that the Keartons say their wines are handmade.
