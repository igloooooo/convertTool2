            Fireblock (formerly Old Station Vineyard) is owned by Bill and Noel Ireland, who purchased the 70-year-old vineyard in 1995. Watervale Riesling, Old Vine Shiraz and Old Vine Grenache are skilfully contract-made, winning trophies and gold medals at capital city wine shows. Exports to the US, Sweden and Malaysia.
