            Chris, Gail and Michael Aylward were involved in the establishment of the Kooyong vineyard and winery, and after selling Kooyong in 2003, retained their 6ha pinot gris vineyard at Shoreham. After careful investigation, they purchased another property, where they have now planted 7ha of pinot noir and 3ha of chardonnay. A small winery has been set up, and the focus will always be on estate-grown grapes. Exports to the UK and Canada.
