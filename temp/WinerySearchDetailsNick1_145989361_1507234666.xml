            Since purchasing the substantial Brokenback Vineyard in 2009 (a key part of the original Rothbury Estate, with vines over 40 years old), Bill and Vicki Widin have wasted no time. Initially the Widins leased the Tempus Two winery, but by the 2013 vintage will have moved into a newly built winery on the Brokenback Vineyard property. Mark Woods will continue to make the wines.
