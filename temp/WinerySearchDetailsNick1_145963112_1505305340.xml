            The winery’s 2.5 ha are situated in mountain country north of Maffra looking towards the Bogong National Park. Hermann Bila comes from a family of European winemakers; the white wines tend to be rustic, the sappy/earthy/cherry Pinot Noir the pick of the red wines. The restaurant serves Devonshire teas and ploughman’s lunches — very useful given the remote locality. B&amp;B accommodation is available.
