            Jim and Jenny Neilson planted their vineyard of shiraz and merlot (1ha each) in 1998. Jim has undertaken the viticulture and oenology degree course at Curtin University, but since 2006 has worked in conjunction with John Griffiths at Faber Wines to produce the wines. Jenny, daughter Sarah and son Ben are all involved in the business.
