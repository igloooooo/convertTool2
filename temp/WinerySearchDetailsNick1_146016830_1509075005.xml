            Perth medical specialist Dr John Rosenthal heads Rosenthal Wines, which is a small part of the much larger 180ha Springfield Park cattle stud situated between Bridgetown and Manjimup. He acquired the property from Gerald and Marjorie Richings, who in 1997 had planted a small vineyard as a minor diversification. The Rosenthals extended the vineyard, which is equally divided between shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. The wines have had significant show success, chiefly in WA-based shows.
