            This is the family-owned business of Mark and wife Tracey Aitken, Traceys mother Jeannette Smith, and her brother Robert and his wife Linda Hatton. Mark became a mature-age student at Curtin University, obtaining his oenology degree in 2001 as Dux, earning a trip to Bordeaux to undertake vintage, returning to work at Manjimups Chestnut Grove winery from 02. In 05 he and Tracey began their own contract-winemaking business, as well as making wine for their Woodgate brand. Most of the grapes come from the estate plantings of cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir and merlot, supplemented by some purchases. The name of the sparkling wine, Bojangles, reflects the familys musical heritage, which stretches back three generations and includes vocalists, guitarists, pianists, a trumpeter, a saxophonist, two drummers and a double bass player.
