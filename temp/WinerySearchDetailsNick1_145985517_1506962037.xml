            This is the venture of John Monteath and Claire Wills; John moved to the Bendigo region in 1999 to pursue his interest in viticulture and winemaking, and while helping to establish the vineyard from which the grapes are sourced, gained experience at Water Wheel, Heathcote Estate and Balgownie Estate wineries. The non-irrigated vineyard was planted in 2000 to four shiraz clones. The tiny crop is hand-picked, and the wine is made in true garagiste style by local winemaker Tony Winspear, with John his assistant. Further plantings within the Bendigo region, and parcels of premium fruit sourced from other meticulously tended vineyards (including Heathcote), have been added to create a range of individual vineyard wines.
