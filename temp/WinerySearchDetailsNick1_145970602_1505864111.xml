            This venture is owned by Colin and Robert Forbes, and their respective partners. Colin says I have been in the industry for a frightening length of time, beginning with Thomas Hardy &amp; Sons in 1974. Currently he is contract winemaking for McLeans Farm, Smallfry, John Dawkins and Partalunga Vineyard,as well as making the wines for Forbes &amp; Forbes. The winemaking is carried out in the shed owned by McLeans Farm.While Colin is particularly attached to riesling, the property owned by the partners in Eden Valley has 2ha each of riesling and merlot, and 1ha of cabernet sauvignon.
