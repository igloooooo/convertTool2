            Lawrence Victor Estate is part of a large SA company principally engaged in harvesting and transport of plantation softwood. The company was established by Lawrence Victor Dohnt in 1932, and the estate has been named in his honour by the third generation of the family. Though a small part of the groups activities, the plantings are substantial, with 11ha of shiraz and 20ha of cabernet sauvignon established between 1994 and 99. An additional 12ha of cabernet sauvignon and 6ha of pinot noir were planted in 2000.
