            The Poonawatta Estate story is complex, stemming from 1.8ha of shiraz planted in 1880. When Andrew Holts parents purchased the Poonawatta property, the vineyard had suffered decades of neglect, and a slow process of restoration began. While that was underway, the strongest canes available from the winter pruning of the 1880s block were slowly and progressively dug into the stony soil of the site. It took seven years to establish the matching 1.8 ha, and the yield is even lower than that of the 1880s block. In 2004 Andrew and wife Michelle were greeted with the same high yields that were obtained right across South Eastern Australia, and this led to declassification of part of the production, giving rise to a second label, Monties Block, which sits underneath The Cuttings (from the new vines) and, at the top, The 1880. The Riesling is produced from a single vineyard of 2ha hand-planted by the Holt family in the 1970s. Exports to France, Denmarkand China.
