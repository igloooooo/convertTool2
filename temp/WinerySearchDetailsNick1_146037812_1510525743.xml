            Canadian-born photographer Guy Lamothe and partner Dena Ashbolt started making wine in the basement of their Carlton home in the 1980s. The idea of their own vineyard started to take hold, and the search for a property began. Then, in their words,one Sunday, when we were just out for a drive, we drove past our current home. The slopes are amazing, true goat terrain, and it is on these steep slopes that in 1994 we planted our first block of pinot noir. While the vines were growing Lamothe enrolled in the winegrowing course at CSU, having already gained practical experience working in the Yarra Valley (Tarrawarra),the Mornington Peninsula and Meursault (Burgundy). 2008 marked the 10th vintage for Wedgetail Estate which, like many others in the Yarra Valley, suffered significant damage from frost and smoke in 07, and smoke and fire in 09. Exports to the UK, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
