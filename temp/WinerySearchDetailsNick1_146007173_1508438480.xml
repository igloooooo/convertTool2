            Gerald Naef s home in Woodbridge in the Central Valley of California was surrounded by the vast vineyard and winery operations of Gallo and Robert Mondavi. It would be hard to imagine a more different environment than that provided by Orange. Gerald and wife Angie left California in 1981, initially establishing an irrigation farm in the northwest of NSW; 20 years later they moved to Orange, and by 2006 Gerald was a final-year student of wine science at CSU. He set up a micro-winery at the Orange Cool Stores, and his first wine was a 2003 Chardonnay, made from vines planted in 99. At its first show entry it won the trophy for Best White Wine of Show at the Orange Wine Show 06, of which I was Chairman. Dream starts seldom come better than this.
