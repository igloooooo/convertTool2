            Bryan and Joy Ellis own this family business, with sales manager Paul Flanagan is Bryanâ€™s son-in-law, and seven of the vineyard blocks are named after family members. For 10 years the Ellises were content to sell the grapes to a range of producers including Taltarni, Domaine Chandon, Mount Langi Ghiran and Heathcote Winery. However, since 2009 a portion of the crop has been vinified, with Greg Flynn (of Flynns Wines) and Guy Rathjen as winemakers.
