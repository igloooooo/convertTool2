            Jamsheed is the venture of Gary Mills, proprietor of Simpatico Wine Services, a boutique contract winemaking company established at the Hill Paddock Winery in Healesville. The wines are sourced from a 30-year-old, low-yielding vineyard, and are made using indigenous/wild yeasts and minimal handling techniques. For the short-term future the business will focus on old vine sites in the Yarra Valley, but will also include a Grampians and Heathcote Shiraz. The name, incidentally, is that of a Persian king recorded in the Annals of Gilgamesh. No wines were received for this edition, the rating is that of last year.
