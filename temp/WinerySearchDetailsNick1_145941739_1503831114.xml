            Founders Barney Flanders and David Chapman have had an amicable business separation. David will be making the wines under the Allies brand, Barney taking on the Garagiste label. Henceforth, David will concentrate on wines from the Mornington Peninsula and, in particular, pinot noir. He plans to release a range of pinot noirs reflecting the diverse sites (climate and soil) of the Peninsula. The wines will be line-priced: in other words, the aim is to highlight differing site characters, rather than differing wine quality.
