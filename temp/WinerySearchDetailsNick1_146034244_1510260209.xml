            The Saunders family (Phil and Wendy, with sons Warren and Mark) began the establishment of their 10-ha vineyard, planted to sauvignon blanc, riesling, semillon, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and pinot noir, in 1998, continuing the plantings in ’99. The name comes from the Two People’s Bay Nature Reserve, which can be seen from the vineyard to the east; it also has spectacular views to the Porongurups and Stirling Ranges 60 km north.
