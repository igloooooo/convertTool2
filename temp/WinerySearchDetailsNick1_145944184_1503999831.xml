            This is the venture of entrepreneur Craig Gore, who has successfully embarked on a major export business to the US, shipping 1.4 million litres in 2010. It has the Henty Estate vineyard in the Granite Belt planted to 11 varieties with an expected yield of 400 tonnes a year, but the major part of the business is based on wine sourced in bulk from producers across South Eastern Australia. Brands include Buckley's Cove, 12 Apostles, Fly and Tamborine (the last reflecting a small 2ha vineyard owned by Aussie Vineyards at Mount Tamborine). Winemaker Jon Heslop has a broad and impressive winemaking background. Exports to the US.
