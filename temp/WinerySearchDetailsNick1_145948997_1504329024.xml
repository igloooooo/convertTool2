            The Schrapel family has been growing grapes in the Barossa Valley for over 140 years, but the winery has only been in operation since 1981. Nestled high on a hillside on the site of an old bluestone quarry, Geoff and Rob Schrapel produce a range of consistently well-made and attractively packaged wines. Bethany has vineyards in the Barossa and Eden Valleys. Exports to the UK, Europe and Asia.
