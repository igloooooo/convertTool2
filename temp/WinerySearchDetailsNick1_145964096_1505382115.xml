            Ross and Christine MacLean have established their vineyard, planted to 1ha each of pinot noir, chardonnay, merlot, sauvignon blanc and shiraz, on a rolling granite plateau at an elevation of 600m, complete with lichen-covered granite boulders and bubbling springs (drought permitting). The wine is made onsite in small, hand-plunged vats and basket-pressed. Exports the UK, The Netherlands and Singapore.
