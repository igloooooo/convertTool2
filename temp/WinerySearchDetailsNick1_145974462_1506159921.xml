            Situated northeast of Toowoomba in the heart of the Darling Downs, this is a substantial venture, having established 32ha of mainstream varieties, and the new breed in the form of tempranillo (4ha) and gamay (2ha). Part of the production goes to Peter Howland in the Hunter Valley, who makes the red wines, and part to Preston Peak, where the white wines and Tempranillo are made. All the Newberry family members, headed by father Ron, are involved in the venture.
