            Dr Russell Bourne is an anaesthetist and former GP at Mt Beauty who has always loved the food, wine and skiing of Northeast Victoria. He completed his oenology degree at CSU in 2002 following his 1998 acquisition of the former Brown Brothers Everton Hills Vineyard. He has since planted 1.6ha of shiraz and viognier, more recently adding counoise, the first planting of this variety in Australia. All wines are estate-grown. Exports to the UK, the US and Hong Kong.
