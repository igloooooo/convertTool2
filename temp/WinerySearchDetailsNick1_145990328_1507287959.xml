            Linda Domas and her eponymous wine business started to take shape during years of working in various parts of Italy, and trips home during the southern hemisphere vintage. Some of the flying winemaking continues, but the Australian component has become more important. As well as the Linda Domas brand, contract winemaking is part of the business; the winemaking is done in leased space at Daringa Cellars. Exports to the UK, the US, Chile, Singapore and China.
