            Luke Lambert graduated from CSUs wine science course in 2002, aged 23, cramming in winemaking experience at Mount Pleasant, Coldstream Hills, Mount Prior, Poets Corner, Palliser Estate in Martinborough, and Badia di Morrona in Chianti. With this background he has established a virtual winery, purchasing grapes from quality-conscious growers in the Yarra Valley and Heathcote. After several trial vintages, the first wines were released from the 2005 vintage. He has now settled in the Yarra Valley, leasing slightly less than 1ha of Heathcote nebbiolo, and similar amounts of Yarra Valley shiraz and nebbiolo (newly grafted). The wines are wild yeast-fermented and bottled without fining or filtration. Exports to the UK and the US.
