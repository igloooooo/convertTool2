            This is the venture of farmer Andrew Taylor, with significant involvement of winemaker Brendon Keys. Andrew had long harboured an ambition to build a winery in the Adelaide Hills, and Brendon, having worked vintages in NZ, Australia, the US and Argentina, was only too happy to join the venture. The estate vineyard is planted to sauvignon blanc; the remaining wines are made from grapes purchased from various local growers. Exports to Singapore.
