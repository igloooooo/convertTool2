            This is the somewhat quirky venture of wine marketer Nick Stacy (West Cape Howe), Michael Kerrigan (winemaker/partner Hay Shed Hill) and Gavin Berry (winemaker/partner West Cape Howe). The brand is primarily directed at the US market, which took 90% of the four wines in the first release, the remaining 10% shared among all other markets. The wines are not primarily sourced from WA, as one might expect, but variously from McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley and the Limestone Coast, with a Verdelho, and the possibility of a Reserve Shiraz, from WA. Divine Light Verdelho, Snake Charmer Shiraz, Red Right Hand Shiraz Grenache Tempranillo and Raconteur Cabernet Sauvignon, coupled with ornate, turn-of-the-19th-century label, give the flavour of the wines and their export focus. Exports to the US, Canada, Denmark, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.
