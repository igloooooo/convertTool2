            This is the venture of John and Pam Love and Andrew and Susie Wright, who have established 3ha each of pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay at an elevation of 820850m at Whitlands, high in the King Valley. The primary purpose is to supply Domaine Chandon with grapes for sparkling wine, but a small amount is made for sale by phone, the prices for the Chardonnay and Pinot very enticing.
