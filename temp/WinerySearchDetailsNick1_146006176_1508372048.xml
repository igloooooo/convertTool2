            In 1999 Peter and Sue Lowrie planted a vineyard on their 20ha Pages Creek property, named after the creek that runs through it. They have cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, chardonnay and merlot. The tiny first vintage (2002) was consumed at their wedding; the first full vintage was 03, and the Pages Creek label was launched in 04. Exports to the US.
