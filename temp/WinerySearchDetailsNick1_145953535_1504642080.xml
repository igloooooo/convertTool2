            Peter Atkins owns the Brunswick Hill Wines venture, which claims to be Melbournes only urban winery, situated in the heart of Brunswick, 15 mins from Melbourne's CBD. Studley Park Vineyard is even closer, but its grapes are sent to Granite Hills for winemaking. A member of the Eltham and District Winemakers Guild, Atkins moved to commercial winemaking after 10 years as an amateur. Brunswick Hill Wines takes grapes from a number of Vic regions, ranging from cool to warm.
