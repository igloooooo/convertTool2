            Mickele and Kaz Amonini purchased the property several years ago, and have built a large, low-slung winery on the site. Some of the vines (grenache and muscat) which still thrive on the property were planted in 1945 by the Waldeck family, and have been carefully tended by successive owners since that time. The plantings now extend to 4ha of chenin blanc, semillon, verdelho, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot on the West Swan Vineyard and 2ha of grenache, muscat, sangiovese and vermentino at the Caversham Vineyard.
