            The wines made by Chris Ringland for his eponymous brand were at the very forefront of the surge of rich, old vine Barossa shirazs discovered by Robert Parker. As a consequence of very limited production, and high quality wine, the wine assumed immediate icon status. The production of 100 dozen does not include a small number of magnums, double-magnums and imperials that are sold each year. The addition of 0.5ha planted in 1999, joining the 1.5ha planted in 1910 has had little practical impact on availability. Almost no wine gets on to the Australian market, with exports (obviously in tiny quantities) to the US, Canada, Belgium, Spain, Singapore and NZ.
