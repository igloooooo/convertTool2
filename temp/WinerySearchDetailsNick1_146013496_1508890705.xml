            The dancing foxes on the label, one with a red tail, give a subliminal hint that this is a virtual winery, owned by Linda Kemp (who looks after the marketing and sales) and Mark Dimberline, who has spent 17 years in the wine industry. Aided by friend and winemaker Tony Walker, they source grapes from McLaren Vale, and allow the Vale to express itself without too much elaboration, the alcohol nicely controlled. Exports to the US, Canada, Germany an Singapore.
