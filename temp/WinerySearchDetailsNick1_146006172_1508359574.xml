            Canungra Valley Vineyards has been established in the hinterland of the Gold Coast with a clear focus on broad-based tourism. Vines (8ha) have been established around the 19th-century homestead (relocated to the site from its original location in Warwick), but these provide only a small part of the wine offered for sale. In deference to the climate, 70% of the estate planting is chambourcin, the rain and mildew-resistant hybrid; the remainder is semillon.
