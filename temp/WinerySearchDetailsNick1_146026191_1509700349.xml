            This multifaceted business owned by New York resident John Streicker. It began in 2002 when he purchased the Yallingup Protea Farm and Vineyards, and was followed by the purchase of the Ironstone Vineyard in 03, and finally the Bridgeland Vineyard, which has one of the largest dams in the region; 1km long and covering 18ha. The Ironstone Vineyard is one of the oldest vineyards in the Wilyabrup area, and required significant rehabilitation after its acquisition. Virtually all the grapes from the three vineyards are sold, and the proteas (from 12ha) are exported to the US and Hong Kong.
