            The vineyards were planted in 1999 on the river flats of Parson Creek, nestled between the Yengo and Wollemi National Parks. The soils were enhanced with organic preparations; after 17 months the 2.2ha of semillon and 1.3ha of merlot produced a substantial crop, the vine growth, equivalent to three years under normal conditions. The intention is to eventually become certified biodynamic. Profits from wine sales support a respite and natural therapies centre for life-limited children that is currently being constructed on the property.
