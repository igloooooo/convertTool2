            The Phelan family established Sutherland Estate in 2000 when they purchased a mature 2ha vineyard at Dixons Creek. Further plantings followed: the plantings now consist of 1ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir, and 0.5ha each of gewurztraminer, cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo and shiraz. Ron Phelan designed and built the cellar door, which enjoys stunning views over the Yarra Valley,while daughter Cathy studied Wine Science at CSU. The sparkling and white wines are made by Phil Kelly, the reds by Cathy and partner Angus Ridley (who has been at Coldstream Hills for the last eight years, and is the winemaker of the Tollana Mornington Pinot Noir).
