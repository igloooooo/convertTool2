            The Palazzo family, headed by Leo, sold its Killara vineyard to Yarragum Agrifoods in November 2010. The family continues to own and run the 36ha Sunnyside Vineyard on the corner of Warburton Highway and Sunnyside Road. Wines produced from the 10 vintage were Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon (Blanc), Dolcino (late-harvest viognier) and Sangiovese (the latter made by Mac Forbes). Exports to the UK and China.
