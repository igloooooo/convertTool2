            Graham and Judy Dalton have planted 2.5ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot, verdelho, chardonnay and semillon, with the first wine produced in 2003. Both have varied backgrounds stretching back to Canberra in the Whitlam era. Graham is an economist-turned-restaurateur, previously a prison reform consultant and running the Qld Farmers Federation. The wines, incidentally, are sold wholesale through Fino Food + Wine of Bulimba, Qld.
