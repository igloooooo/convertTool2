            A long-established and perfectly situated winery reaping the full benefits of its 40-year-old vines; recent plantings have increased production. All the wines are well made, the Shiraz providing further proof (if such be needed) of the suitability of the variety to the region. In 2011 was purchased by the Ed Peter partnership,owner of the adjoining Yarra Yering Winery; the intention is to keep the Warramate Vineyard and brand as a separate entity.
