            Kellys Creek draws on 1ha of riesling and 0.2ha each of chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon. Its majority owner is Darryl Johnson, who runs the vineyard with help from Guy Wagner, who describes himself as merely a marketing minion. Small quantities of Riesling are made for Kellys Creek; has had success at the Tasmanian Wines Show.
