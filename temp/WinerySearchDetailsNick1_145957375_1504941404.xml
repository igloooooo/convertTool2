            This is the venture of father Arthur, son Mark and grandson James Chapple. Together they have planted a little under 3ha of shiraz and 0.4ha of chardonnay on a site overlooking the Cairn Curran Reservoir, midway between the historical gold mining towns of Maldon and Newstead. The basket-pressed Shiraz is made in three distinctly different styles labelled Bold Red, Winemakers Classic and Reserve, all French oakmatured.
