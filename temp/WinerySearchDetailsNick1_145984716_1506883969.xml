            A typical family-owned (by Gerard and Joy Terpstra) Mornington Peninsula vineyard, situated in the Dromana/Red Hill area on rising, north-facing slopes, just 3km from the shores of Port Phillip Bay, immaculately tended and with picturesque garden surrounds. Fragrant Riesling and cashew-accented Chardonnay are usually its best wines from the organically certified vineyard. Exports to Canada and Japan.
