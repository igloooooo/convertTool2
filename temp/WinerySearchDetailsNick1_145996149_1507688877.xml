            This may be a part-time labour of love for general practitioner Dr Anthony Miceli, but that hasnt prevented him taking the whole venture very seriously. He acquired the property in 1989 specifically to establish a vineyard, planting 1.8ha in 91. Subsequent plantings have brought it to its present size, with pinot gris, chardonnay and pinot noir the varieties grown. Between 91 and 97 Dr Miceli completed the wine science course at CSU and now manages both vineyard and winery. One of the top producers of sparkling wine on the Peninsula.
