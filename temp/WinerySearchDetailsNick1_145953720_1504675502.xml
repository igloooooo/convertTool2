            David (a consultant metallurgist in the mining industry) and Jan Jenkinson have established 2.5ha of vines on a sunny, sheltered north to northeast slope in the North Esk Valley. The 12ha property on which their house and vineyard are established gives them some protection from the urban sprawl of Launceston. Jan is the full-time viticulturist and gardener for the immaculately tended property.
