            Ruth and Tony Marsh run a part-time wine business, making the wine onsite, with support from Madrez Wine Services, from micro plantings (0.25ha each) of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz plus a trial block. The estate-grown grapes are supplemented by contract-grown fruit sourced from other Central Ranges areas at Meadow Flat, Oberon, Bathurst and Rylstone.
