            The Redbank brand was for decades the umbrella for Neill and Sally Robbs Sallys Paddock. In 2005 Hill-Smith Family Vineyards acquired the Redbank brand from the Robbs, leaving them with the Redbank winery and Sallys Paddock label. Redbank Alpine Valley purchases grapes from the King Valley, Whitlands, Beechworth and the Ovens Valley (among other vineyards sources). Exports to all major markets.
