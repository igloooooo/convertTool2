            Maritime Estate is the venture of the Ruljancich family since brothers John and Kevin purchased the property in 1993. The first vines had been established by Dr Hugh Robinson, who continued to be involved with the vineyard for many years, until management passed to the present viticulturist, Matthew Frewer. Plantings were expanded in 95 to their present level of 2.7ha of MV6, 114, 115 and 777 clones of pinot noir, 1ha of chardonnay and 0.8ha of pinot gris. The familys involvement with wine dates back to the early 1800s, with vines on the tiny Dalmatian island of Vis, Croatia. The Ruljancichs migrated to Australia in 1946, but the vineyard on Vis was still being attended until the 80s by John and Kevins uncle. John died in 2007, but the business continues on under the care of Kevin and Johns children, Jane, Paul and Sally.
