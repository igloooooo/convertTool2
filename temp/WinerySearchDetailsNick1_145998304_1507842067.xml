            Tim Harrop and Katarina Romanov-Harrop planted their first vines in 1990, and the first olive trees in 2001 (the latter now extended to 800 trees and a commercial olive oil and olive business). Despite the name, the vines are planted on the floor of the Moorabool Valley on the bank of Moorabool River; there are 2ha of shiraz and 1ha each of semillon, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot. For the first 10 years the grapes were sold, but thereafter part of the production was retained for the Moorabool Ridge label and sold through the cellar door situated in the historic Sheppards Hut dating from 1856.
