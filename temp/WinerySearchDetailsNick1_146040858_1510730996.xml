            Mark Arnold is the man behind Winetrust Estates, drawing on a lifetime of experience in wine marketing. It is a virtual winery operation, drawing grapes from three states and five regions using contract winemakers according to the origin of the grapes (either contract-grown or produced under a joint venture). The top-of-the-range Picarus red wines come from the Limestone Coast; the other ranges are Ocean Grove and Firebox, covering all the major varietal wines plus a few newcomers. Exports to the US, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand.
