            This micro-business is owned by Joe and Sue Evans. Joes life on the land started in 1984 with a diploma of horticulture in nursery management, followed three years later by a viticulture degree from Roseworthy/Adelaide University. Between 92 and 99 he had various responsibilities at Rockford Wines, 9295 in the cellar door, 96 vintage cellar hand, and 9799 vineyard manager. Since that time he has been a man for all seasons at Greenock Creek Wines. A cheesery is also on the property, operated by Sue and sister Tracey Skepper. Water and waste recycling is a major focus of the business, with a vegetable garden supplying local restaurants and selling through the Barossa Farmers Market.
