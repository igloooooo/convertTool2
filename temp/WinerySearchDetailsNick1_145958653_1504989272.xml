            Nicholas Paterson took over responsibility for this tiny winery following the death of father David during the 1993 vintage. The lions share of plantings is shiraz (the first plantings), with smaller blocks of chardonnay, marsanne, roussanne, viognier and mourvedre; most of the grapes are sold, with a tiny quantity of shiraz being made into a marvellous wine. Davids legacy is being handsomely guarded.
