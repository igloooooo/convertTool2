            Brackenwood Vineyard is situated at the extreme southern end of the Adelaide Hills, skirted by the Old Victor Harbour Road. Damon Nagel has established shiraz (2.65ha), riesling (1.7ha), sauvignon blanc (1.3ha), nebbiolo (1.2ha) and chardonnay (0.75ha), and all wines are estate-grown. The vineyard has been managed biodynamically for four years, and the wines are made without the addition of acidity or yeast nutrients, all ferments relying on wild yeast.
