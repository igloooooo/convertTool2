            Kate Kirkhope has sold her Yarra Valley vineyard and moved to the Bellarine Peninsula. The brand name Kiltynane Estate is being retained, the grapes in future coming partly from the Yarra Valley and partly from Swan Bay. Back vintages of Kiltynanes Yarra Valley-grown and made wines are also still available. Exports to Denmark.
