            Remo and Mark Crisante have pushed the viticultural envelope that little bit further by planting 2ha of chardonnay, verdelho, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and traminer at Kurrajong, for long a holiday destination for Sydneysiders. The fact that Kurrajong is in the South Coast Zone may come as a surprise, since it is 100km northwest of Sydney, but the Zone boundaries have always been a matter of convenience, and had to be so drawn as to cover all of the state. A restaurant and accommodation are available, pointing to the conference and function market.
