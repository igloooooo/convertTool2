            Owned by Mr KC Huang and family, Toolleens 17.5ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and durif are planted on the western slope of Mt Camel, 18km north of Heathcote. The lower Cambrian red soils are now well recognised for their suitability for making full-bodied and strongly structured red wines. Most of the wine (80%) is exported to Canada, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.
