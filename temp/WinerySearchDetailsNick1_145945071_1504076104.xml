            Balgownie Estate continues to grow in the wake of its acquisition by the Forrester family, and celebrated its 40th vintage at Maiden Gully in 2012.A $3 million winery upgrade coincided with a doubling of the size of the vineyard, and Balgownie Estate also has a cellar door in the Yarra Valley (Yarra Glen). The Yarra Valley operation of Balgownie Estate neatly fits in with the Bendigo wines, each supporting the other. Balgownie has the largest vineyard-based resort in the Yarra Valley, with over 65 rooms and a limited number of spa suites. It specialises in catering for conferences and functions, and Raes Restaurant is open seven days for breakfast and lunch. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, The Netherlands, Fiji, Hong Kong, Singapore and NZ.
