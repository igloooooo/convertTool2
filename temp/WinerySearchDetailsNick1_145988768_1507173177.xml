            Founder and owner Con Lymberopoulos is a former PE teacher who built himself a house in the Clare Valley before deciding to plant 1ha of vacant land next door to vines. Together with one of his closest friends, and a collection of other partners, he began buying land and vineyards in the Clare Valley, building the holdings to an impressive 20ha at Watervale, and 90ha at Quarry Road, Clare. The labels and wine styles are different to most, as is the Last Word Inn, a combined caf, restaurant, take away and cellar door, open 7 days for prodigiously long hours, particularly on the weekend.
