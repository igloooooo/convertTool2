            After a brief period of ownership by industry veteran Bill Clappis (who renovated and reopened the winery), ownership has now passed to the Cogno family, which has been winemaking at Cobbity, near Camden, NSW, since 1964. Through Middlebrook the family has become one of the largest producers of Lambrusco in Australia; it is available Australia-wide through Liquorland stores. Many other wines (18 in all) are produced under the Cogno Brothers label; the Middlebrook cask hall has been given over to production of the Medlow chocolate range. The top wines are still sold under the Middlebrook label.
