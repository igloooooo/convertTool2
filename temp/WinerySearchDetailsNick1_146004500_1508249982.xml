            The Nurihannam wines are made at the Nuriootpa High School by what must be the largest winemaking team in the world per bottle of wine produced. Each year 75100 Year 10 students assist agriculture teachers with the viticulture and winemaking. Made and sold under the Barossa Class and Barossa Scholar labels, they are available at the Nuriootpa Vine Inn, Kaeslers and Chateau Tanunda.
