            Sue and Sean Delaney purchased their property at Norton Summit in 1997. The property had a significant stand of remnant native vegetation, with a State Conservation Rating, and much energy has been spent in restoring 8ha of pristine bushland, home to 130 species of native plants and 66 species of native birds, some recorded as threatened or rare. The vineyard has been a DIY venture for the Delaneys, with Sue hand-pruning the 0.4ha each of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc planted in 98. The adoption of biodynamic viticulture has coincided with numerous awards for the protection of the natural environment and, more recently, eco-tourism; they operate the only eco-certified cellar door in the Adelaide Hills, and have won innumerable ecological and general tourism awards. Sparkling wine disgorgement demonstrations are a particular attraction.
