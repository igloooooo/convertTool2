            The Kalleske family has been growing and selling grapes on a mixed farming property at Greenock for over 100 years. Sixth-generation Troy Kalleske, with brother Tony, established the winery and created the Kalleske label in 1999. The vineyard is planted to shiraz (27ha), grenache (6ha), mataro (2ha), chenin blanc, durif, viognier, zinfandel, petit verdot, semillon and tempranillo (1ha each). The vines vary in age, with the oldest dating back to 1875, and the overall average age is about 50 years; all grown organically. Exports to all major markets.
