            The explanation of the winery name is simple: it is the name of the town near the vineyard, which is halfway between Piedmont and Nojee. Ivan and Ljubica Juric started the venture as a hobby in 1991, initially inspired by generations of winemaking by their ancestors in Croatia, an inheritance reflected by the 'Taste of Croatia' lunches offered by the Jurics. Since that time they have expanded twice, the vineyard now comprising 1ha each of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and shiraz.
