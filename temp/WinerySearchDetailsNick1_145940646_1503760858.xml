            Cindy and Roy Manassen have lost no time in establishing a Garden of Eden on their Southern Highlands property (which has the misleading name of Avoca, something outside their control, of course). It is a home away from their Mosman residence, and the extravagantly beautiful Japanese garden, French garden, silver birch grove and ornamental pond (tended by resident horticulturist Peter Hastings) are wholly remarkable. You might think this is just a plaything for a well-to-do Sydney family, but in fact Cindy completed her wine science degree from CSU in 2004, and both during her studies and since, has worked several vintages in Gevrey Chambertin in France. Pinot noir (1.5ha) is the most important variety, supported by 1ha each of shiraz and sauvignon blanc. The vineyard was planted in 1999, and subsequently pruned from 6.5 to 3.5 ha, to make it more manageable.
