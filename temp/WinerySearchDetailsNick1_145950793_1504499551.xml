            Borry Gartrell and Gaye Stuart-Nairne have planted pinot noir, sauvignon blanc, pinot meunier, gewurztraminer and chardonnay adjacent to a cherry, plum and heritage apple orchard and truffiere. It is a 10-min drive from Orange, and adjacent to Lake Canobolas, at an altitude of 1000m. The wines have been consistent medal winners at regional and small winemaker shows.
