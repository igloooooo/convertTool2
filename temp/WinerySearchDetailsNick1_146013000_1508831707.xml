            Chateau Hornsby may be no more (previously the only winery in the state), but John and Shirley Crayford have filled the void by establishing Red Centre Wines on the Stuart Highway, 180km north of Alice Springs. They have established a small planting of shiraz, ruby cabernet, riesling and chardonnay, but specialise in mango wines. The conventional wines are made for them by Geoff Patritti in McLaren Vale.
