            Cyril and Jan Ciavarellas vineyard was begun in 1978, with plantings being extended over the years. One variety, aucerot, was first produced by Maurice OShea of McWilliams Mount Pleasant 60 or so years ago; the Ciavarella vines have been grown from cuttings collected from an old Glenrowan vineyard before the parent plants were removed in the mid 1980s. Tony Ciavarella left a career in agricultural research in mid 2003 to join his parents at Ciavarella. The family is justifiably proud of the breadth of the range of wines it offers, albeit in small quantities.
