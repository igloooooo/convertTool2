            Peter and Lee Hedberg have established their hilltop vineyard 4km west of Orange, with 0.8ha each of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, tempranillo, chardonnay, viognier, sauvignon blanc and riesling. The cellar door, opened in June 2010, has great views of Mt Canobolas and the surrounding valleys. The appointment of Wallace Lane/Phil Kerney as winemaker has seen a significant increase in quality, however difficult the 2011 vintage proved to be.
