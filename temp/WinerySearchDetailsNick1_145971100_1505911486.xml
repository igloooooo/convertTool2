            The Frog Rock label was launched in 1997 by the Turner family, named after local frog- shaped granite boulders on land granted to famous explorer and grazier William Lawson in 1823. The vineyard, on deep alluvial clay soils, employs minimal irrigation and sprays; plantings include cabernet sauvignon (13ha), shiraz (12ha) and chardonnay (4.5ha), with lesser amounts of merlot, semillon, petit verdot and chambourcin. Exports to Hong Kong.
