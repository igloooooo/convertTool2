            Anthony Carapetis, Philippe Morin and Chris Taylor have collective experience of over 50 years working in various facets of the wine industry, Morin as a leading sommelier for over 25 years, and presently as Director of French Oak Cooperage, Carapetis and Taylor as long-serving winemakers. The dream of Quattro Mano began in the mid 1990s, but only became a reality in 2006 (Im still not sure how three equals four). They now have an eclectic range of wines,Tempranillo the cornerstone, extending at one extreme to the multi-Iberian Peninsula Duende, and to La Deft Pinot Noir and La Hada Barossa Valley Mourvedre at the other. Its an impressive, albeit small, business. Exports to Japan.
