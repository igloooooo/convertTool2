            Through sheer consistency, value for money and unrelenting hard work, the Marsh family has built up a sufficiently loyal cellar door and mailing list clientele to allow all the production to be sold direct. Wine style is always straightforward, with oak playing a minimal role, and prolonged cellaring paying handsome dividends.
