            Robyn Dickens and Leigh Coleman have established Myrtle Vale Vineyard on a property between Yea and Mansfield at 330m. The name comes from a sheep station selected in the mid-1800s, of which the vineyard now forms a small part. Cabernet sauvignon (2ha), chardonnay (1ha) and a tiny patch of viognier are used to make the wines, while surplus grape production is sold.
