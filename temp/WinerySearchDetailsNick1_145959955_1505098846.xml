            The Shepherd family acquired Clemens Hill in 2001 after selling their Rosabrook winery in the Margaret River. They also have a shareholding in Winemaking Tasmania, the contract winemaking facility run by Julian Alcorso, who makes the Clemens Hill wines. The estate vineyard includes pinot noir (3.3 ha; 1.5ha replanted in 09) and sauvignon blanc (2ha).
