            Established by the van der Meer family, it is one of the oldest wineries in the Perth Hills (once the largest), for a while setting the standard. The vineyard is set on steep terraced slopes, surrounded by bushland, and are maintained with the minimum of fertilisers and chemicals. The award-winning restaurant is also open for dinner Fri-Sat.
