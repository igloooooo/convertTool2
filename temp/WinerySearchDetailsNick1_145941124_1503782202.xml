            Tim Stevens is a busy man. In 1996 he acquired the then 25-year-old Abercorn Vineyard, and in late 2005 purchased the very well known adjacent Huntington Estate. He has developed his skills as a winemaker, enabling him to keep the style of the Abercorn and Huntington wines quite distinct. He describes Abercorn as the modern, smooth, regional style, with the A Reserve and the Growers Revenge leading the way.
