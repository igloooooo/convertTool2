            The small, effectively dry-grown vineyard was established by Graeme and Joy Sweet, who ultimately sold it to David and Tanya Bryant.The pinot noir, chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon grown on the property have always been of the highest quality and, when Coldstream Hills was in its infancy, were particularly important resources for it. For some years the wines were made by Phillip Jones (Bass Phillip), but the winemaking is now carried out onsite by David and Tanya Bryant.
