            Situated east of Dardanup in the picturesque Ferguson Valley, Wansbrough enjoys views of the distant Geographe Bay and the nearer State forest, and has the Bibblemun Track running along the vineyards northern and eastern borders. Brian and Kristen Wansbrough have planted 9ha of riesling, sauvignon blanc, semillon, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and shiraz; all but a small amount of the grapes are sold to others.
