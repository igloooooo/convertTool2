            The cellar door of Heathcote Winery is situated in the main street of the region, housed in a restored miners cottage built by Thomas Craven in 1854 to cater for the huge influx of gold miners. The winery is immediately behind the cellar door, and processed the first vintage in 1983, following the planting of the vineyards in 78. In 97 the winery was purchased by an independent group of wine enthusiasts, led by Stephen Wilkins. When first established, the emphasis was on white wines, but it has since moved decisively in the direction of Shiraz and Shiraz Viognier, with 60% of the total plantings devoted to shiraz. Part of this move came with the establishment of the Slaughterhouse Paddock Vineyard, 3km north of Heathcote, with 4ha of shiraz.
