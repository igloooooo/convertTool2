            Rocland Estate is primarily a bulk winemaking facility for contract work, but Frank Rocca does have 6ha of shiraz to make the Rocland wines, supplemented by contract-grown grapes. Largely destined for export markets but with retail distribution in Adelaide. Rocland releases wines under the Lot 147, Kilroy Was Here, Duck Duck Goose, Chocolate Box, and the charmingly named Ass Kisser labels. Exports to the UK, the US, Singapore, China and NZ.
