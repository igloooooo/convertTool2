            Dr John and Sue Ward moved from Sydney to WA with the aim of establishing a vineyard and winery, settling first on a property in the Middlesex Valley of Pemberton. Despite the success of that venture, they have decided to move to the Geographe region, where they have purchased a 51ha block of granite-strewn rocky hillside facing north and west at Burekup, 200m above sea level, looking towards the Indian Ocean. They have retained the Angelicus label and the stock from their previous vineyard. In 2009 they began the planting of their vines, the lions share to grenache (bush vines, managed biodynamically), five clones of tempranillo, and verdelho. In the interim, they are purchasing grenache, mourvedre, shiraz and tempranillo from growers in the region.
