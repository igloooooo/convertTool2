            Situated on the north-facing slopes of Fenton Hill at Clarkefield, just northeast of Sunbury, the Hume and Macedon Ranges provide a spectacular and tranquil setting. It is a small family operation, with plantings of shiraz, chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon. Co-owner David Spiteri studied winemaking at Charles Sturt University, and has vintage experience in Australia and California.
