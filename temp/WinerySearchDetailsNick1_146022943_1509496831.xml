            Simon Adams and wife Helen purchased a 3.2ha vineyard in 1996, which had been planted by Pastor Franz Julius Lehmann (none other than Peter Lehmanns father) in 1932. Peter Lehmann always referred to it as Dads Block. They have added 0.25ha of viognier, which, as one might expect, is used in a shiraz viognier blend. Most recent plantings are of shiraz (2.5ha), riesling (1.7ha), cabernet sauvignon (0.7ha) and traminer (1.5ha). Nonetheless, the top wines, The Family Shiraz and The Thing Shiraz, need no assistance from viognier. Only six barrels of The Thing are made each year, using the best grapes from Dads Block. The Adams have opened the Sorby Adams Wine Room &amp; Pantry in Angaston, open for tasting throughout the day, with daily blackboard specials for lunch dining, and all-day antipasto plates and cheese boards available. Exports to Hong Kong, China and NZ.
