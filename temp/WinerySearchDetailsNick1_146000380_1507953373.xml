            Howard and Christine Reddish have established two vineyards, one of 2ha surrounding the winery, the other of 3ha on the slopes of Mt Markey, at an altitude of nearly 500m. The winery is built on the site of the Cassilis Wine Palace, which served the local gold mining families for almost 70 years until the gold ran out in the 1940s.
