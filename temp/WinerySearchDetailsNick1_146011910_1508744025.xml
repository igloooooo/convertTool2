            In 1988 David Muir and Robert Hance (and their wives) purchased a property on V&amp;A Lane and planted 16ha of vines. Since then the vineyard area has expanded considerably with the development of a further three vineyards, including the cellar door block that is situated on the Riddoch Highway. In 1996 a winery designed by Peter Bissell was built, and in late 99 the Punters Corner Retreat accommodation centre was opened. While judging the Limestone Coast Wine Show, I frequently had occasion to eat at the Retreat; it has won various architectural and tourism awards. Punters Corner had a moment of glory when its 1999 Spartacus Reserve Shiraz won the Jimmy Watson Trophy 00.  Exports to Canada, The Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and China.
