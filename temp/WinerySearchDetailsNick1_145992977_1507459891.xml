            This is a partnership between Rolf Binder and Cambridge (UK) wine merchant Noel Young. It came about in 1993 when there was limited demand for or understanding of Southern Rhne-style blends based on shiraz, grenache and mourvedre. Initially a small, export-only brand, the quality of the wines was such that it has grown over the years, although the intention is to limit production. The majority of the wines are reasonably priced, the super-premiums more expensive. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Austria, Finland, Belgium and the Bahamas.
