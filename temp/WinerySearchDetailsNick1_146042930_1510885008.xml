            This is the second time around for Domenic Bucci, who built the first stage of Eyton-on-Yarra (now Rochford) before being compelled to sell the business in the hard times of the early 1990s. He has established 2ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha of merlot, supplemented by chardonnay, which is supplied in return for his winemaking services to the grower.
