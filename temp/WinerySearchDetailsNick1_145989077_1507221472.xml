            Sydney Hamilton purchased the unplanted property that was to become Leconfield in 1974, having worked in the family wine business for over 30 years until his retirement in the mid 50s. When he acquired the property and set about planting it, he was 76, and reluctantly bowed to family pressure to sell Leconfield to nephew Richard in 81. Richard has progressively increased the vineyards to their present level, over 75% to cabernet sauvignon, for long the winerys specialty. Exports to the UK, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, China and NZ.
