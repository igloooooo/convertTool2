            Corey and Belinda Jessup have spent a lifetime in the wine industry. In 2004, after 14 years with the company, they entered into a management buy-out with the owners of Sunraysia Nurseries, Peter and Lois Smith. Sunraysia is one of the largest growers of vines, citrus trees, avocados, olives, pistachio and pomegranate trees in Australia. It seemed no more than sensible to vertically integrate the business by establishing 35ha of the main varieties; most of the grapes are contracted to a large, local winery, with just enough retained to take winemaking beyond the hobby stage, with a local contract winemaker presiding. The Blue Yabby name has a great story which space prevents me from telling.
