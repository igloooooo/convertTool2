            The very substantial wine business of the Dal Broi family is only part of group activities: the family has 250ha of rice, 1000ha of wheat, and is also involved in heavy earth moving equipment, transport and real estate in the Riverina and surrounding districts. The family has over 400ha of mainstream varieties, supplemented by contract purchases both within and without the Riverina region (thus there's a Padthaway Chardonnay and Barossa Valley Shiraz in the Reserve range). At the bottom is Dal Broi Red Hill, then The Red Deer Station and at the top, Yarrenvale Station. The wines are made at the former Miranda winery.
