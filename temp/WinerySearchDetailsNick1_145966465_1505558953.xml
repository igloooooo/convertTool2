            Jeff and Val Howard own Dudley Wines and its three vineyards on Kangaroo Islands Dudley Peninsula: the Porky Flat Vineyard, Hog Bay River and Sawyers. It is the quirky vineyard names that give the wines their distinctive identities. The Howards not only look after viticulture, but also join in the winemaking process. Most of the wines are sold through licensed outlets on Kangaroo Island.
