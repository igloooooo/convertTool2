            A somewhat unusual venture, owned by Deakin University, but managed by winemaker Duncan MacGillivray. Two ha each of chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, and 1 ha each of viognier, riesling, sauvignon blanc, merlot and petit verdot were planted in 2002. Grapes from the early vintages were sold to other Geelong wineries, notably Scotchmans Hill, but from 2005, encouraged by the quality of the grapes, increasing quantities have been retained for wines under the Waurn Ponds Estate label.
