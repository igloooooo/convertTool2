            Dr Paul Sibraa, and wife Pamela, purchased a former grazing property in 1992. It is situated at an elevation of 600m on the ranges between Bowral and Mittagong, and planting of the 22.5ha of vines began in 1998. In descending order of area, the varieties are chardonnay, merlot, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, pinot gris, shiraz and sauvignon blanc. In 2005 Paul Sibraa decided to produce single vineyard wines under the GrumbleBone label, his inspiration going back to 78 when he first met Max Lake in his Hunter Valley winery.
