            Rothbury Ridge has an extraordinarily eclectic choice of varieties planted, with between 1.2 ha and 2.4 ha each of chardonnay, semillon, verdelho, chambourcin, durif, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. It is owned by a public company (not listed on the Stock Exchange) with an imposing array of directors, and actively markets its wines through a wine club.
