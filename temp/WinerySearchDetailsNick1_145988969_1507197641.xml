            The 5.6-ha Lawson Hill Estate vineyard was purchased from its founders by a group of business associates and friends in 2001. The cellar door takes advantage of the sweeping views out over the vineyards and to the west. A full varietal range is made by noted Hunter winemaker Rhys Eather.
