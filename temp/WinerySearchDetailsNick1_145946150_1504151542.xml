            Barossa Valley Estate is now solely owned by Barossa Growers Holdings Limited, the latter representing the grower shareholders of the original co-operative. The 40ha of vines directly owned by Barossa Valley Estate (shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, grenache, chardonnay and marsanne) contribute only a small part of the production, most of the grapes coming from the grower shareholders. Across the board, the wines are full-flavoured and honest. E&amp;E Black Pepper Shiraz is an upmarket label with a strong reputation and following; the Ebenezer range likewise. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
