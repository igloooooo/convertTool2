            Guy Darling was one of the pioneers of the King Valley when he planted his first vines in 1970. For many years the entire production was purchased by Brown Brothers for their well-known Koombahla Estate label. Much of the production from the 23ha is still sold to Brown Brothers (and others), but since 1991 Guy has made a small portion of the production into wine at the onsite winery  which was, in fact, his original aim. The wines are sold with considerable bottle age.
