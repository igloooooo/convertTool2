            Having been farmers in the Colbinabbin area of Heathcote for 27 years, John and Patricia Kennedy were on the spot when a prime piece of red Cambrian soil on the east-facing slope of Mt Camel Range became available for purchase. They planted 20ha of shiraz in 2002. As they gained knowledge of the intricate differences within the site, and worked with contract winemaker Sandro Mosele, further plantings of shiraz, tempranillo and mourvedre followed in 07. The Shiraz is made in small open fermenters, using indigenous yeasts and gentle pigeage before being taken to French oak (20% new) for 12 months maturation prior to bottling.
