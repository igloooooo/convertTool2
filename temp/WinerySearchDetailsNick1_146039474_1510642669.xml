            In the wake of the demise of the Hotham Valley wine group, and its subsequent restructuring and renaming, James Pennington acquired the 5.5-ha Wildwood vineyard, planted in the mid-1980s. The vineyard was established without irrigation and remains dry-grown. All future releases will be under the Wildwood of Yallingup label or Pennington.
