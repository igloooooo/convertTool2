            Tallavera Grove is one of the many wine interests of Dr John Davis and family. The family is a 50% owner of Briar Ridge, a 12ha vineyard in Coonawarra, a 100ha vineyard at Wrattonbully (Stonefields Vineyard) and a 36ha vineyard at Orange (the Carillion wines are sourced from this vineyard). The 40ha Hunter Valley vineyards are planted to chardonnay, shiraz, semillon, verdelho, cabernet sauvignon and viognier. The Mount View winery will eventually be equipped to handle 200-300 tonnes of fruit.
