            This is a full-blown virtual winery, owning neither vineyards nor winery. Gary Collins is a 22-year veteran of the wine industry in Sydney, and CEO Peter Salt, who works in the recruitment industry, has turned a consumers love of wine into a business enterprise. The partners seek out premium parcels of grapes, and then employ winemakers such as James Kellie (in Great Southern, WA) to make the wines.
