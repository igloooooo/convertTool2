            La Violetta is owned by husband and wife team Andrew Hoadley and Hanna Reichel, who first met in Canberra and worked several vintages together at Constellations Kamberra Winery. Andrew had majored in history at the University of Queensland, and completed a wine science degree from CSU in 2003. Rhineland-born Hanna Reichel has a PhD in entomology, and completed three-quarters of the CSU wine science degree before children intervened. Andrews first wine experience was pruning for De Bortoli in the Yarra Valley in 1997, before going on to work at Bay of Fires, Cumulus Wines, Dominion Wines and Kamberra, also winemaking in Piedmont and Washington State. The couple has now settled in Denmark, where Andrew is winemaker with Castelli Estate, and able to make the small amounts of La Violetta wines at that winery. Exports to the UK.
