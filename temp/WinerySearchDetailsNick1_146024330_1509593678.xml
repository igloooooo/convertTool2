            Owner/winemaker Mick Cann has established vines on the famous deep-red Cambrian clay loam on the east face of the Mt Camel Range. Planting began in 199495, with a further extension in 2000. Shiraz (3ha), merlot (1ha) and petit verdot (0.3ha) are the main varieties, with a smattering of cabernet sauvignon and semillon. Part of the grape production is sold to David Anderson of Wild Duck Creek Estate, the remainder made by Mick, using open fermentation, hand-plunging of skins and a basket press, a low-tech but highly effective way of making high quality red wine. The period poster-style labels do the wines scant justice.
