            The family-owned Farosa Estate has 11ha of shiraz and 3ha of mataro (mourvedre) in production. The aim is to produce a full-bodied wine with as little preservative as possible, with open fermentation and oak maturation varying between 10 and 18 months. To date, winemaking has taken place in the Barossa Valley, but the family is contemplating building its own winery.
