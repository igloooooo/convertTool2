            Morgan Simpson was founded by SA businessman George Morgan (since retired) and winemaker Richard Simpson, who is a graduate of CSU. The grapes are sourced from the Clos Robert Vineyard (where the wine is made), planted to shiraz (11.8ha), cabernet sauvignon (3.6ha), chardonnay (1.8ha), mourvedre (3.5ha), sauvignon blanc (2.5ha), semillon and chardonnay (1.8ha each), and established by Robert Allen Simpson in 1972. Most of the grapes are sold, the remainder used to provide the reasonably priced, drinkable wines for which Morgan Simpson has become well known.
