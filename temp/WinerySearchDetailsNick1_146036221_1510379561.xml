            Owners Don Luca, Marco Iannetti and Anthony De Pizzol all have backgrounds in the wine industry, none more than Don, a former board member of Tatachilla. He also planted the Luca Vineyard in 1998 (20ha of shiraz, 5ha each of grenache and cabernet sauvignon). The majority of the grapes are sold, but since 2004 steadily increasing quantities of wine have been made from the best blocks in the vineyard. Exports to Canada, Malaysia and NZ.
