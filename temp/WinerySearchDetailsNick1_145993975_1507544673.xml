            Janette Kenworthy and Michael Sweeny are both committed organic grapegrowers and are members of the Organic Vignerons Association. Their small operation is growing, with shiraz (2ha), sauvignon blanc (1.5ha), cabernet sauvignon (1ha) and pinot noir (0.5ha) in productions. The vineyard is carbon neutral, with solar electricity and plantings of native trees and shrubs. Organic vineyard tours and talks can be arranged by appointment.
