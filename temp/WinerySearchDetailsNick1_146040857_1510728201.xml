            This is a separate venture from Australian Domaine Wines (solely owned by Mario and Ben Barletta), owned by the Barlettas and Mike Backhouse. The Barlettas have great experience in all aspects of the wine trade, and Mike brings a different professional business experience career to the venture. The focal point of the business is the production of single vineyard/single varietal wines, predominantly from McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley and Clare Valley. It has two labels: Singular, which meets the main criteria; and D.O.V., standing for dried on vine. These wines go in a separate directions, presumably with Italian Amarone wines somewhere in the background. Exports to the US, Germany, Switzerland and Japan.
