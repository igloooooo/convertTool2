            Peter Howland graduated from Adelaide University in 1997 with a first-class Honours degree in oenology. He has worked in the Hunter Valley, Margaret River, Hastings Valley, Macedon Ranges and Puglia in Italy. Newcastle may seem a strange place for a winery cellar door, but this is where his insulated and refrigerated barrel shed is located. From 2004 he has fermented his wines at Serenella Estate, where he also acts as contract winemaker. His wines are sourced from both sides of the continent: Great Southern and the Hunter Valley. Exports to the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan.
