            This is the venture of Paul and Kate Stuart, nominally based in the Hunter Valley, where they live and have a vineyard planted to shiraz and mourvedre; nominally, because Pauls 30 years in the wine industry have given him the marketing knowledge to sustain the purchase of grapes from various regions, including the Hunter Valley, Canberra and interstate. He balances the production and sale of his own wines under the Eclectic label while also acting as an independent marketing and sales consultant to other producers, avoiding a conflict of interest by selling his clients wine in different markets from those in which he sells his own. Exports to Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany and China.
