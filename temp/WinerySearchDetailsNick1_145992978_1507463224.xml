            Stuart Brown and Rosemary (Roe) Gartelmann purchased the property on which Magpie Springs is now established in 1983, for growing flowers commercially and grazing cattle. Chardonnay was planted experimentally, and were among the earliest vines in the area. In 1991 the commencement of the vineyard proper led to the planting of a little over 15ha of semillon, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, merlot, shiraz, riesling and gewurztraminer. Roe paints professionally from the Magpie Springs studio, and many classes and workshops have been held over the years; her studio can be visited during cellar door hours.
