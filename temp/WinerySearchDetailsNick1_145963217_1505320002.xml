            David Hook has over 25 years experience as a winemaker for Tyrrells and Lakes Folly, also doing the full Flying Winemaker bit with jobs in Bordeaux, the Rhne Valley, Spain, the US and Georgia. The estate-owned Pothana Vineyard has been in production for over 25 years, and the wines made from it are given the Old Vines banner. This vineyard is planted on the Belford Dome, an ancient geological formation that provides red clay soils over limestone on the slopes, and sandy loams along the creek flats; the former for red wines, the latter for white. Exports to the US and Japan.
