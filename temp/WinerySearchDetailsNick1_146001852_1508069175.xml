            The Murdock family has established 10.4 ha of cabernet sauvignon, 2 ha of shiraz, 1 ha of merlot, 0.8 ha of riesling and 0.5 ha of chardonnay in Coonawarra, and produces small quantities of an outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon, contract-made by Pete Bissell. A second vineyard has been added in the Barossa Valley, with 5.8 ha of shiraz and 2.1 ha each of semillon and cabernet sauvignon. The labels, incidentally, are ultra-minimalist; there’s no flood of propaganda here. The Barossa Valley cellar door is now open 7 days 10–5 (Magnolia Road, Vine Vale). Exports to Canada and Singapore.
