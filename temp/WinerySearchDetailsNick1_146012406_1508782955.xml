            Owner Des Quilty grew up in the Hunter Valley and studied agriculture at the University of New England, Armidale. To support himself while at university, he drifted into viticulture, his first job after graduation at Tyrrells as assistant vineyard manager. He was soon promoted and formed part of the Tyrrells management team in the first half of the 1990s. Over the latter half of the 90s he worked for a rural outlet supplying products to Hunter Valley grape and wine producers, before moving to Mudgee as a viticulturist around 2000. While his focus remains on that region, he has also been involved in vineyards in Orange and Young. With a wife and two young children, he ventured into small-scale winemaking in 08, relying on the depth of his experience to secure small parcels of top quality grapes to make top quality wines.
