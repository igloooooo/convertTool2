            Fabric Wines is the brainchild of Adelaide-born owner/winemaker Alana Langworthy. The inspiration for the brand came from a London wine bar and the theme of interwoven wines from Limestone Coast regions. A vineyard has been purchased in the Clare Valley, and came into production in 2010. In late 2008 she left the security of employment with Coonawarra Developments to work full-time on Fabric Wines. A cellar door is planned.
