            In the wake of the acquisition of Rothbury by Mildara Blass, Len Evans' wine interests focused on Evans Family (estate-grown and produced from vineyards around the family home), the Evans Wine Company (a quite different, part-maker, part-negotiant business) and, most recently, Tower Estate (see separate entry). The family is considering the future of the business in the wake of Len Evans?? untimely death in early 2007. Exports to the US.
