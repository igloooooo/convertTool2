            Paul Nelson has a remarkably youthful face for someone who started making wine with one foot in the Swan Valley, the other in the Great Southern region of Denmark, while completing a bachelors degree in viticulture and oenology at Curtin University. He then worked successively at Houghton in the Swan Valley, Goundrey in Mount Barker, Santa Ynez in California, South Africa (for four vintages), hemisphere hopping to the Rheinhessen, three vintages in Cyprus, then moving to a large Indian winemaker in Mumbai before returning to work for Houghton at Nannup. He has since moved on from Houghton to employment elsewhere, but (in partnership with wife Bianca Swart) makes small quantities of table wines.
