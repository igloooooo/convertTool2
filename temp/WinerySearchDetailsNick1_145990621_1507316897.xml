            This is a micro-operation run by Cate Lister, with estate plantings of chardonnay, roussanne, viognier and marsanne, the grapes for Soliloquy continuing to be purchased until the perfect spot is found. The tiny production means the wines are mainly sold through word of mouth and mail order, and small retail outlets in SA.
