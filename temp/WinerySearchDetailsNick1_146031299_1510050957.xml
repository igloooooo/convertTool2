            The business is owned and operated by the husband-and-wife team of Peter and Susan Moore. Susans family have lived in Armidale for six generations, Peters family for five. The vineyard lies on part of a farm where Peters family has run sheep and cattle enterprises for the past 50 years. They say the vineyard was the love child of a perfect Hunter Valley hangover after celebrating Susans 40th birthday in May 2003. A month later the site was chosen, and by November the vines were planted, and there was no turning back. The first vintage was 06, but in 10 they decided to change winemakers, with the aim of reducing their carbon footprint by using a local winemaker, also allowing them to become involved in the winemaking.
