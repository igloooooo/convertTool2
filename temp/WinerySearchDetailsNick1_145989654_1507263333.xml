            The Carypidis family runs two brands: Pure Vision (15ha of certified organically grown grapes), and Lights View (with a much larger planting of conventionally grown grapes). Growing grapes under a certified organic regime is much easier if the region is warm to hot and dry, conditions unsuitable for botrytis and downy mildew. You are still left with weed growth (no herbicides are allowed) and powdery mildew (sulphur sprays are permitted) but the overall task is much simpler. The Adelaide Plains, where Pure Visions vineyard is situated, is such a region, and owner Ken Carypidis has been clever enough to secure the services of Jim Irvine as co-winemaker. Exports to the US, Canada, Taiwan and China.
