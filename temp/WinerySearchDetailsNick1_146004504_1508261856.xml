            Ferdinando DeBlasio left Italy bound for Australia when he was 13 years old, with both grandfather and father having made wine for home consumption every year. In 1963 he purchased a 20ha paddock on Oak Avenue (near Mildura airport) with 4ha of established vines. With the help of wife Joanne the plantings were slowly expanded, and completed by 1972. In 1980 a 4ha property on Deakin Avenue was purchased, and by 99 a little under 3ha of shiraz had been planted, the onsite winery built the following year.
