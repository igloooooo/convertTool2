            Graeme and Maggie Ray started their vineyard in 1978, planting small quantities of riesling and chardonnay. Since then the vineyard has grown to over 30ha with the addition of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, barbera, pinot gris and other experimental lots. It is situated on northeast-facing slopes at an altitude of 350m, with warm summer days and cool nights. Wines are produced under the Boggy Creek and Top Crossing labels. Exports to the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.
