            David and Mary Ell began the development of their vineyard on fractured granitic and volcanic soils in 1986. Planting of the pinot noir and chardonnay was completed in 90, but a small plot of clone 115 pinot noir has recently been added. Balgownie Estate founder Stuart Anderson moved to Macedon many years ago, and has added his immense knowledge to the crucible of learning on the job. The wines are made in the small winery on the property. Exports to Canada, Singapore and Malaysia.
