            This is a life and winemaking partnership that (in their words) draws on the experience and knowledge of two people who fell for each other over their shared love of wine. The two are former Fosters/TreasuryWine Estates senior winemaker Glenn James and winemaker partner Amanda Pritchard. I suspect she was responsible for the following words,Glenn is the brains behind the entire operation. Amanda is an avid product sampler and sometimes nails a press release. Other times she offends journalists with her use of the term balls. As well as giving up secure employment with guaranteed income, they have decided to forsake the security of mainstream varieties such as shiraz and chardonnay, instead focusing on aglianico, fiano and vermentino for white wines, mataro for the first red.
