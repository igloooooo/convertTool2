            The Barritt family has been growing grapes in the Barossa since the 1850s, but this particular venture was established in 05 by Lenore, Joe and Greg Barritt. It is based on shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay (with tiny amounts of zinfandel, pinot blanc and clairette) planted between 1972 and 03. Greg runs the vineyard operations; Joe, with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree from Adelaide University, followed by 10 years of winemaking in Australia, France and the US,is now the winemaker, together with Tim Geddes at McLaren Vale,where the wines are made. Exports to Hong Kong.
