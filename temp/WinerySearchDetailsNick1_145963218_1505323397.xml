            David Traeger learned much during his years as assistant winemaker at Mitchelton and knows Central Victoria well. The red wines are solidly crafted, the Verdelho interesting and surprisingly long lived. In 2002 the business was acquired by the Dromana Estate group, but David Traeger continues as winemaker. (See also Baptista entry.) Exports to the UK, Japan, Italy and Canada.
