            Barry Miller acquired the 45ha Salem Bridge property in 1988. A little under 2ha of cabernet franc were planted in 1989, and Cabernet Franc was the only commercial release prior to 99. However, a further 14ha have been planted to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot, with a Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon release in the pipeline. The core business is contract growing, with only 10% of the production vinified for Salem Bridge.
