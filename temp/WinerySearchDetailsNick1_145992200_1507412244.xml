            The Lucys Run business has a variety of offerings of wine, cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil and self-catered farm accommodation. The wines are made from estate-grown shiraz (1.9ha), verdelho and merlot (1ha each). The feisty label design is the work of local artist Paula Rengger, who doubles up as the chef at the nearby Shakey Tables Restaurant, itself the deserving winner of numerous awards.
