            Neil and Leann Tuffields vineyard is situated in the hills behind the coastal town of Yallingup. The name was inspired by a family of magpies who consider the property part of their territory. Vineyard plantings (shiraz, semillon, chenin blanc, verdelho, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and muscat a petit grains) are supplemented by purchased sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Exports to Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand.
