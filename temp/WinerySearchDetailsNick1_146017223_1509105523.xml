            Owner/winemaker Nick Bickford has had, to put it mildly, an interesting career, starting in McLaren Vale, carousing through Roseworthy Agricultural College for a few years, then Flying Winemaking in California and Oregon, briefly settling for vintages at Dromana Estate and Tarrawarra before flying off again to winemaking in Provence, Brazil and Moldova. Oh, and a stint at the legendary McCoppins bottle shop in Melbourne. Somewhere along the way he picked up a strong belief in organic/biodynamic practices, so the grapes for the first two wines (grown at Canowindra) come from organic certified, low-yielding vineyards, the wines likewise accredited. Neither spends any time in oak, helping to keep the price user-friendly.
