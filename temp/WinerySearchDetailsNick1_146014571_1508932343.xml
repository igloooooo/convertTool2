            Partners Peter Evans, Sonia Mailer, Craig Wellington and Susan Wellington commenced planting the 18.5ha vineyard in 1998; the varieties chosen were riesling, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot. While it is situated at the extreme southern end of the Macedon Ranges, the partners correctly anticipated that achieving full ripeness with the red varieties might be difficult in cooler vintages. However, winemakers John Ellis and Trefor Morgan, with input from Peter Evans, have done an excellent job with the white wines since the inaugural vintage of 2001.
