            The beautifully situated McIvor Creek winery is well worth a visit and offers wines in diverse styles; the red wines are the most regional. Peter Turley has 5ha of cabernet sauvignon and 2.5ha of cabernet franc and merlot, and supplements this with grapes from other growers. Exports to Japan and Singapore.
