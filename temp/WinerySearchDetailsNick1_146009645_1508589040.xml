            Sally Milner and John Nutt planted their vineyard (1ha of riesling and 0.6ha each of pinot gris, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon) in 1999. The newly extended and renovated cellar door and caf has views of Mt Ainslie, Mt Pleasant, Duntroon, the Telstra Tower, Parliament House and the Brindabella Ranges beyond. The property, which has a 1-km frontage to the Molonglo River, is only a 5-min drive from the centre of Canberra.
