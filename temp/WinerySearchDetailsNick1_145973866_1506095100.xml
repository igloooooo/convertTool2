            You might be tempted to say of the owners that Lisa is a solicitor who runs the administrative side of the business, while husband Sandy looks after production, sales and marketing, but theres rather more to it. While Sandy was gaining his BA (History) from the University of Sydney he worked in several of Sydneys great restaurants, including Bathers Pavilion and Mezzaluna. He also worked as a fashion model in Sydney, New York and Milan. In 2001 he moved to Adelaide to undertake the Adelaide University oenology course, graduating with Honours in 2004. He worked with a number of leading winemakers, including Stephen Henschke and Tim Adams, but left his position as winemaker at Tim Adams to follow Lisa to Brisbane, where she had accepted a role as in-house legal counsel for a large property group. Sandy is now Group Sommelier for the Katarzyna Group, which has Brisbanes largest venue,?Cloudland. Along the way Sandy and Lisa acquired several properties at Springton in the Eden Valley and Gawler in the Barossa Valley, and Sandy spends much of his year travelling between Adelaide and Brisbane, making, blending and bottling the wines. Exports to India.
