            Pete and Di Smith established the first vineyard in Beechworth in 1978, with the encouragement of John Brown Jr of Brown Brothers. In 2003 the winery and vineyard were taken over by their daughter Sarah and husband Will Flamsteed. At 550m, the vineyard is predominantly chardonnay (1.8ha), with some cabernet sauvignon (1ha) and merlot (0.5ha), which make the estate wines.Will and Sarah made their first Beechworth Shiraz in 2006. The Heathcote Shiraz was a response to the smoke taint and frost damage in 2007. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year.
