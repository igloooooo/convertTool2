            Anthony Brain, with six vintages under his belt at Bellarine Estates onsite winery, is now a district veteran. With the second string of the Bellarine Brewing company (which makes the only micro-brewed beer on the Bellarine Peninsula) also situated in the winery, and the extended operating hours of Julians Restaurant, it is a popular meeting place. The vineyard is planted to chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot, viognier and sauvignon blanc. Exports to the US.
