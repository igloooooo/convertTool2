            Karl Wilhelm Roehr arrived in Australia in 1841, and was amongst the earliest settlers at Ebenezer, in the northern end of the Barossa Valley. His great-great grandson Elmor Roehr is the custodian of 20ha of shiraz, grenache, mataro on a vineyard passed down through the generations. In 1995 he decided to venture into winemaking and produced a Shiraz from 80-year-old vines which typically crop at less than 1.5 tonnes to the acre; he has subsequently expanded the range significantly.
