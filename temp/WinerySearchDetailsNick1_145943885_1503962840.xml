            While the establishment date of Arrivo is 1998, when Peter Godden and partner Sally McGill established a nursery block of 35 vines of nebbiolo, the inspiration goes back to 90, while Peter was still at Roseworthy College, heading off the following year to become assistant winemaker to Joe Grilli at Primo Estate. In 1995 and 96 Peter spent much time in Barolo, Italy, working the 96 vintage at leading producer Vietti. In the meantime, Sally had become a leading Italian wine exporter and importer/distributor with Red+White. By 2001 they had propagated sufficient vines from the original 35 to plant 1ha of vineyard, using a unique trellis and training system derived from Barolo, but with an Australian twist. Not only is the trellis complicated and unique, but so are the amazingly complicated fermentation techniques being used by Peter Godden, best known these days for his work with the AWRI. Exports to the UK.
