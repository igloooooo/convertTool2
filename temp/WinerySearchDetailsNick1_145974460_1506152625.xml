            Bill and Mick Quinlan-Watson, supported by a group of investors, began the development of Waterhouse Range Vineyards Pty Ltd in 1995, planting 15ha of vines, with further plantings over the following few years lifting the total area under vine to just under 60 ha. The majority of the grapes are sold. The name comes from the third Governor of SA, Frederick Holt Robe, who in 1845 selected the site for a port and personally put in the first survey peg at Robe.
