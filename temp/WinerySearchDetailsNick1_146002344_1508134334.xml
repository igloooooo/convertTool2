            The Curran family established its 110ha vineyard adjacent to the Belubula River at Canowindra in 1996. The vineyard was named in honour of forebear Joseph Barbeler, who had been involved in a similar endeavour 140 years earlier in the Duchy of Nassau on the river Rhine near Frankfurt. A significant proportion of the grapes is contracted for sale to one of Australias largest wineries; selected amounts are retained and contract-made for the Nassau Estate label.
