            When Blair and Jolyon Montague became interested in starting a vineyard in the Perth Hills, they sought the advice of the famed viticultural researcher Dr John Gladstones. He studied the climate of what became Beltana Springs, describing it as very similar to the Douro Valley in Portugal, suggesting a focus on grape varieties suited to warmer climates. Thus shiraz and grenache collectively lead the plantings, together with cabernet sauvignon. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
