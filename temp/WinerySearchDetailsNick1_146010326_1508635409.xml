            Fred and Katrina Pizzini have been grapegrowers in the King Valley for over 30 years, with a substantial vineyard. Originally much of the grape production was sold, but today 80% is retained for the Pizzini brand, and the focus is on winemaking, which has been particularly successful. Their wines rank high among the many King Valley producers. It is not surprising that their wines should span both Italian and traditional varieties, and I can personally vouch for their Italian cooking skills. Katrinas A tavola! cooking school opened in 2010 with lessons in antipasti, gnocchi, ravioli, cakes and desserts, and of course, pasta. Exports to Japan.
