            John Law and family planted 1.9ha of pinot noir and 1.5ha of chardonnay in 1996 as contract growers for several leading Mornington Peninsula wineries. Plantings have been progressively expanded, now including small amounts of pinot gris, lagrein and gewurztraminer. Some of the grapes are now contract-made, and they have two labels: Point Leo Road for premium wines, and Point Break the second label.
