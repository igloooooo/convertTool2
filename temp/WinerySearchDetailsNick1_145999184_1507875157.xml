            Morialta Vineyard was planted in 1989 on a site first planted to vines in the 1860s by John Baker. The Bunya pine depicted on the label is one of the few surviving trees from that era, and indeed one of the few surviving trees of that genus. The 20ha property has 11ha under vine, planted to chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, shiraz and merlot. Most of the grapes are sold. Given the age of the vineyard and winemaking by Jeffrey Grosset, it is not surprising that the wines have done well in the Adelaide Hills Wine Show.
