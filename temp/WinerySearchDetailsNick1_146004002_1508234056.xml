            In 1996 the Spence family purchased a run-down farm at Lower Norton and, rather than farming the traditional wool, meat and wheat, trusted their instincts and planted vines on the elevated, frost-free, buckshot rises. The surprising vigour of the initial planting of shiraz?prompted further plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc. The vineyard is halfway between the Grampians and Mt Arapiles, 6km northwest of the Grampians region, and will have to be content with the Western Victoria Zone, but the wines show regional Grampians character and style. A traditional Wimmera ripple-iron barn has been converted into a cellar door.
