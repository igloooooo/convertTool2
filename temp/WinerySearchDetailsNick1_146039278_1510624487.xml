            Wild Dog is a family-owned business operated by Gary and Judy Surman. Since acquiring the business in 2005 much work has been done in the vineyard (planted in 1982) with grafting, replanting and retrellising; winery expansion (all wines are now made onsite); they have also built a restaurant overlooking the vineyard. Now one of the larger wineries in Gippsland, having won four trophies at the Gippsland Wine Show 08 and Most Successful Exhibitor in 09, it would seem there is much to be confident about. Exports to China and Japan.
