            Chris and Alice Harding have taken a circuitous route to the Margaret River, Chris interest in wine blossoming while working at the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron in the late 1970s, before moving to Scotland. He and wife Alice returned to Australia in 1994, settling in the Margaret River region with their young family. They established the Viticlone Supplies Grapevine Nursery, and now have 60 varieties and over 120 clones available. Some of the more exotic varieties in propagation are vermentino, fiano, mondeuse, lagrein, sagrantino, cilliegiolo and sangiovese brunello di montalcino. They have established 1ha of viognier, encouraged by the early results from this variety. They have also purchased cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and merlot from a single vineyard site in the northern part of the Margaret River.
