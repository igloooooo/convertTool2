            This is a family-owned winery established by the OToole family of Perth; while the establishment date is 2008, the vineyard was then already 10 years old. Planted to chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, semillon, merlot and sauvignon blanc, it is adjacent to the Big Brook Forest from which it takes its name. Throughout the year a brook runs through the vineyard and feeds the dam, which has a population of the much-prized marron. It is seldom called on to provide water for the vines, which are predominantly dry-grown. Exports to the US.
