            Moorooroo Park Vineyards is owned by Wyndham and Patricia House, who have had many years experience in the catering business. It is part of a larger venture known as the Jacobs Creek Retreat, established in 1996 for accommodation, with ongoing restoration of the historic buildings set among lavish French-inspired gardens. It has nothing to do with the Pernod Ricard Jacobs Creek; place names cannot be trademarked, hence the ability to use the Jacobs Creek name. They have a little over 1ha of shiraz planted to clone 1654, and also purchase grapes from other growers.
