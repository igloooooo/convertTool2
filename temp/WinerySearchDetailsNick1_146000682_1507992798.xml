            English-born and trained Andrew Mountford and wife Sue migrated to Australia in 1983, and were one of the early movers to select Pemberton for their vineyard. The cool climate and spectacular forested countryside were important considerations in the move. Their strikingly packaged wines are produced from permanently netted, dry-grown vineyards (pinot noir, chardonnay, merlot, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc). Exports to the UK.
