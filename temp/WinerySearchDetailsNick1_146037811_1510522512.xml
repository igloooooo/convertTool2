            This is the venture of Andrew Wood and Lisa Robertson, the culmination of their wayward odyssey. Andrew left his career as a sommelier in London, and retrained as a winemaker, working in Portugal, the UK, Italy and the Granite Belt (an eclectic selection if ever there was one), and settling in McLaren Vale in early 2004. Working with Kangarilla Road winery for the next six years, while making small quantities of Shiraz, Cabernets and Tempranillo from purchased grapes, led them to Nebbiolo and shiraz, the first vintage of those varieties in 12. The wines are made in small batches, utilising cold soaking and extended maceration.
