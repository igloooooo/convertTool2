            Few enterprises have cast such a broad net over the tourist traffic in the Mornington Peninsula. The estate has The Pig &amp; Whistle Tavern and cellar door, the 5-star Views Restaurant (which also serves 70 local and imported beers), a beer garden, produce store, fly fishing, antiques, and rose and lavender gardens. Almost incidental are the 7ha of pinot gris and pinot noir.
