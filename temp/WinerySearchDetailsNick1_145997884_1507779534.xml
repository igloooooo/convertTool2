            Michael and Suzanne (Lew) Wynne-Hughes planted their micro-vineyard of pinot noir (Dijon clones), gamay and sauvignon blanc in 2000. MLF does not (in this instance) stand for malolactic fermentation, but Michael and Lews Folly. Despite the minuscule size of the plantings, Michael and Lew aim to release separate bottlings of each of the 114, 115 and 777 pinot clones, together with a blend of the three. The infinite care taken in the vineyard (possible with such small plantings) has allowed a sale and share arrangement with another Mornington Peninsula winemaker, the quality of the wine attesting to the quality of the grapes.
