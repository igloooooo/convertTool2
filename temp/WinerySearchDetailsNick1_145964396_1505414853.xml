            One of the Yarra Valleys finest producers of Pinot Noir and an early pacesetter for the variety, making wines of tremendous style and crystal-clear varietal character. They are not cabernet sauvignon lookalikes but true pinot noir, fragrant and intense. The Chardonnays show the same marriage of finesse and intensity, and the Cabernet family wines shine in the warmer vintages. In early 2005 the brand and wine stocks were acquired by Graeme Rathbone, the Lances continuing to own the vineyard and winery, and make the wine. The vineyards and winery were burnt in the Black Saturday bushfires of February 09; re-establishment is well underway. Exports to the UK.
