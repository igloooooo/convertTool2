            John and Lynne Derwin lost everything in the Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009: their house, the winery, the restaurant, all bottled wine on the premises, and the trellising and irrigation system in the scorched and blackened vines. Poignantly, their distributor John Davey, his wife, and two children died in the Kinglake fire. The only thing spared was bulk-bottled stock stored elsewhere, which will be gradually sold until the Derwins are able to fully come to grips with the financial consequences of the fire. They do not wish to walk away from 10 years of effort building the brand, but what they will rebuild, and when the process will begin, is as yet uncertain.
