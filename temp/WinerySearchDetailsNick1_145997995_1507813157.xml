            Former mining company executive Max Montgomery and wife Rita purchased the property on which they have established their vineyard in 1987, after a 12-month search of the region. It has a northeast-facing slope, and the usual well-drained gravelly soils. In 99 they began the planting of cabernet sauvignon, malbec and petit verdot. They are slowly moving to biodynamic management of their vines.
