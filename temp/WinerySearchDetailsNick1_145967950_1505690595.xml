            Epsilon (the fifth-brightest star in a constellation) takes its name from the five generations of the Kalleske familys involvement in Barossa Valley grapegrowing; Julie Southern is ne Kalleske. She and husband Aaron bought back this part of the family farm in 1994, initially selling the grapes, but in 2003 joined forces with close friends Dan Standish and Jaysen Collins to produce the Epsilon wines. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada and Southeast Asia.
