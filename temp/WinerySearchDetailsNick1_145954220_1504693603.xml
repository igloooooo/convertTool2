            After 18 years at Lancefield Winery in the Macedon Ranges, Andrew Pattison moved his operation a few miles north in 2004 to set up Burke &amp; Wills Winery at the southern edge of Heathcote, continuing to produce wines from both regions. While establishing 2ha of shiraz, 0.5ha of gewurztraminer and 0.5ha of merlot, malbec and petit verdot at Burke &amp; Wills, he still retains a 20-year-old vineyard at Malmsbury at the northern end of the Macedon Ranges, with 1ha each of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, malbec, cabernet franc, and 0.5ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir. Additional grapes come from contract growers in Heathcote.
