            Bimbadeen Estate has 1.2ha of semillon, shiraz and verdelho, but is primarily driven by its six self-contained villas perched high on the side of the Brokenback Range, with panoramic views out across the Hunter Valley, and which deserve the hyperbole often encountered in describing ventures of this kind.
