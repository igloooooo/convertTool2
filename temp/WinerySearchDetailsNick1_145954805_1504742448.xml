            This is the former Colmaur, purchased by Jeanette and Lindsay Kingston in 2005. They had just sold their business, built up over 22 years, and thought they were returning to country life and relaxation when they purchased the property, with 1.5ha of vines equally split between pinot noir and chardonnay (plus 700 olive trees). Says Lindsay, somewhat wryly,We welcome visitors. The last lot stayed three hours.
