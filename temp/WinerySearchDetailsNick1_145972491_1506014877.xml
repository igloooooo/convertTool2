            The business was started by Judith and Gerry Gauntlett, who planted 1.5ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot on the Tuart sands of Wanneroo in 1990, making the first wine in 95. In the wake of Gerrys death, the family has continued the business. Appropriately, the name comes from the Balm of Gilead produced from trees on the hills northeast of Galilee in Biblical times, and was said to have had healing and purifying qualities. The small production is mainly sold by mail order.
