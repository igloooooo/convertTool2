            Arundel was built around an acre of cabernet and shiraz planted in the 1970s but abandoned. When the Conwell family purchased the property in the early 1990s, the vineyard was resurrected and the first vintage was made by Rick Kinzbrunner in 95. Thereafter the cabernet was grafted over to shiraz, the block slowly increased to 1.6 ha, and an additional 4ha of shiraz and 1.6ha of viognier and marsanne planted.
