            It all looked too good to be true, and so it proved for this new name in Coonawarra. It is part of Coonawarra Developments Pty Ltd, which is in turn the owner of Chardonnay Lodge, the only large-scale (and ever-growing) accommodation complex in the heart of Coonawarra. Founded by the Yates family over 20 years ago, it now offers 38 large suites and a deservedly popular restaurant. Most recently, and in a way most significantly, Coonawarra Developments also purchased the former Jamiesons Run Winery from Fosters. Financial problems led to the sale of the winery on 30 June 11; it is now known as Coonawarra Jack Winery. In a separate transaction, Gold Wine Sales purchased The Poplars bulk and bottled wine stock, labels and trademarks. Most of the wines are now being made for export, with smaller quantities available on the Australian market. Gold Wine Sales has shareholder links with Taiwan, leading to increased sales there. Exports to China and Taiwan.
