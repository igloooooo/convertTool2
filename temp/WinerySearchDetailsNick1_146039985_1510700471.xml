            Winchelsea Estate raises as many questions as it answers: its owner is itself a vineyard, with a Flinders Street, Adelaide, address. It is a chardonnay specialist with 8 ha of vines situated on three different terroirs, the grapes being separately harvested, and the identity of each wine likewise protected. Thus there is Warri Chardonnay, said to be the leanest of the three, closest to Chablis; Alkira, said to be an Australian interpretation of fine White Burgundy; and Karalla, being the ‘fat boy’ of the trio, the red wine drinkers chardonnay. There is also a Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir.
