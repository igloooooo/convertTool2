            This is the venture of winemaker Michael Schreurs and Karina Ouwens, a commercial lawyer from Adelaide. Daughter Amalia Schreurs can hoover a box of sultanas in record time while Meesh, the family cat, treats Karina and Amalia well, and Michael with the contempt he deserves. As cats do. One or other of the partners (perhaps both) has a great sense of humour. Michaels winemaking career in Australia began with Seppelt Great Western winery for three years, followed by six years at Henschke, and, more recently, The Lane Vineyard in the Adelaide Hills, backed up by stints in Burgundy, the Rhne Valley, the US and Spain.
