            Melbourne academic Dr Teunis Kwak and wife Dorothy have a 4ha fully mature vineyard, part planted in 1976, the remainder in 88. The deliberately low-yielding vineyard was established on a fairly steep, picturesque, undulating hillside. Over the years the Kwaks have built four major, and a couple of lesser, stone buildings on the property, all from sandstone sourced onsite or from their neighbours paddocks. A number of left-field wines are made, including a Vintage Pinot Port, a Chardonnay Liqueur and a Sparkling Cabernet Franc, and the Kwaks cheerfully admit that even their table wines are calculated to please their cellar door customers rather than wine show judges. Exports to China.
