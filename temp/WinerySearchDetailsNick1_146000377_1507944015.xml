            Owner/winemaker Stephanie Toole has never deviated from the pursuit of excellence in the vineyard and winery. She has three vineyard sites in the Clare Valley, each managed using natural farming and organic practices. Stephanie has continuously built on the business since becoming sole owner in 1993, with the cellar door in the old, renovated, Auburn railway station. The attention to detail and refusal to cut corners is obvious in all of her wines. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
