            The Swings &amp; Roundabouts name comes from the expression used to encapsulate the eternal balancing act between the various aspects of grape and wine production. Swings aims to balance the serious side with a touch of fun. There are now four ranges: Kiss Chasey, Life of Riley, Swings &amp; Roundabouts and the Backyard Stories. Exports to the US and China.
