            This is the venture of industry veterans who should know better: Paul Clancy, long responsible for the Wine Industry Directory that sits in every winery office in Australia, and Peter Fuller, who has built up by far the largest public relations business for all sectors of the wine industry. They own 0.5ha of shiraz planted in the 1880s, 1ha of 40-year-old shiraz, 2ha of 60-year-old grenache and 2ha of mataro.
