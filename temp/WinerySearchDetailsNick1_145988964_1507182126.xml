            Laurel (hence Laurel Bank) and Kerry Carland began planting their vineyard in 1986 to sauvignon blanc, riesling, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. They delayed the first release of their wines for some years and (by virtue of the number of entries they were able to make) won the trophy for Most Successful Exhibitor at the Hobart Wine Show 95. Things have settled down since; wine quality is very reliable.
