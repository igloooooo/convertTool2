            Esteemed (and dare I say now senior) journalist Bob Mayne planted 1.6 ha of shiraz in McLaren Vale in 1995, without any clear objective in mind; he was certainly not venturing into winemaking. However, one thing leads to another, and in 1998 he formed Neighbours Vineyards Pty Ltd, its 14 shareholders all being McLaren Vale grapegrowers.
