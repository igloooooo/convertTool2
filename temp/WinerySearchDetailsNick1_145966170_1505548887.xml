            The Stavropoulos family established Dromana Valley Wines in 1974, planting a small block of shiraz. When the Hickinbotham family purchased the property across the road in 1988 it led to the first Dromana Valley wines being made by Andrew Hickinbotham, and to the extension of the vineyard in 89, with further plantings in 97. There is now a little under 2ha of chardonnay, over 1ha of pinot noir, the remaining 2ha divided between shiraz and cabernet sauvignon.
