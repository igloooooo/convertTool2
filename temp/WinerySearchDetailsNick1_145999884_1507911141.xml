            Phil McNamara began planting the vineyard to shiraz, barbera, chardonnay, tempranillo, semillon and verdelho in 1997 on the west side of Wollombi Brook. Over the years since coming into production, the wines have been prolific medal winners in regional and boutique wine shows. Most of the grapes are sold, with limited production under the Mount Broke label.
