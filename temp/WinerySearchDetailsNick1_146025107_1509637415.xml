            Colin and Helene Hellier acquired a 49-ha grazing property at Cowaramup in 1993; it included 2.5 ha of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc planted in 1987. A large dam was constructed in 1994, and the following year 11 ha of new vineyards and 4 ha of olive trees were planted; 1.6 ha of zinfandel followed in 1996, bringing total plantings to 15 ha. The majority of the 100 tonne grape production is sold to other local wineries, with 14-15 tonnes being retained for the Stellar Ridge label.
