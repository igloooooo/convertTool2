            Lynn and Paul Walter had been keen observers of Mudgee and its wines for 15 years before deciding to take the plunge and plant a 17ha vineyard. It was the mid 1990s, and all the portents were good. As competition increased, and prices for grapes decreased, they realised that their original business plan of simply being growers for local producers was not going to be financially viable, even though they thought the downturn would prove to be a temporary one. In 2005 they had an opportunity to export bulk wine to Germany, and this triggered a decision to also have wine contract-made for sale under their own label. The quality of the wine they have produced thoroughly justifies that decision.
