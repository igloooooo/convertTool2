            Hackersley is a partnership between the Ovens, Stacey and Hewitt families, friends since their university days, and with (so they say) the misguided belief that growing and making their own wine would be cheaper than buying it. They found a little piece of paradise in the Ferguson Valley just south of Dardanup, and in 1998 they planted just under 8 ha, extended since then to 11.5ha, of the mainstream varieties; interestingly, they turned their back on chardonnay. Most of the crop is sold to Houghton, but a small quantity is made for the Hackersley label. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year.
