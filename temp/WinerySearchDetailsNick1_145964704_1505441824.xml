            Dean OReilly has a background in the distribution of fine table wines, culminating in employment by Met Hennessy Australia. He has accumulated the UK-based WSET Intermediate and Advanced Certificates, completed various other programs and competitions, and has been associate judge and judge at various Canberra district events. He has also travelled through the wine regions of NZ, Champagne, Bordeaux, Chablis, Piedmont and Tuscany. In 2009 he was one of 12 wine professionals selected to participate in the week-long Len Evans Tutorial. The wines are made at Capital Wines, with Andrew McEwen overseeing Deans apprenticeship; the grapes come from the block owned by Dean adjacent to the Pambula River.
