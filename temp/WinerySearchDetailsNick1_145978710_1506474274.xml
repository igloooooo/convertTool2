            Dean Hewitson was a winemaker at Petaluma for 10 years, during which time he managed to do three vintages in France and one in Oregon as well as undertaking his Masters at the University of California (Davis). It is hardly surprising that the wines are immaculately made from a technical viewpoint. Dean has managed to source 30-year-old riesling from the Eden Valley and 70-year-old shiraz from McLaren Vale; he also makes a Barossa Valley Mourvedre from vines planted in 1853 at Rowland Flat and Barossa Valley Shiraz and Grenache from 60-year-old vines at Tanunda. Between 2008 and 10 Dean progressively established his own winery at Dorrien, completing it in time to process the 10 vintage. A new cellar door opened mid-2012. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
