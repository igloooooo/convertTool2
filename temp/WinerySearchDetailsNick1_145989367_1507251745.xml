            Liebich Wein is Barossa Deutsch for Love I wine. The Liebich family have been grapegrowers and winemakers at Rowland Flat since 1919, with CW Darkie Liebich one of the great local characters. His nephew Ron began making wine in 1969, but it was not until 92 that he and wife Janet began selling wine under the Liebich Wein label. The business has grown surely but steadily, with a new warehouse commissioned in 2008 vastly improving storage and handling capacity. Exports to the UK, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore and China.
