            The development of the quite extensive Kurabana Vineyard, west of Geelong in the foothills of Mt Moriac, began in 1987. Pinot noir (7.8ha) is the largest portion, followed by (in descending order) shiraz, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot gris and viognier. In 2009 there were a number of major changes: the name of the business was changed, and it purchased the Waurn Ponds Estate label and all current wine from Deakin University. It also leased the Waurn Ponds vineyard from Deakin, lifting the aggregate area to 35.3ha. The two brands continue, but have a common headquarters and ownership.
