            Ria and Wayne Hammond run a vineyard, beef cattle and sustainable blue gum plantation in undulating country on the Capel River in the southwest of WA. The grapes are grown on light gravel and loam soils that provide good drainage, situated high above the river, giving even sun exposure to the fruit and minimising the effects of frost. The vineyard is planted to shiraz, merlot, cabernet sauvignon, muscat, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, and the wines have won a number of medals at wine shows.
