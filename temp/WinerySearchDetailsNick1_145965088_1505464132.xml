            The somewhat ghoulish name and label illustration is a reminder of bygone days when wild dogs were caught in traps in much the same way as rabbits. It certainly means the name of the venture will be remembered. Planting of the vineyard began in 1996, with a smaller addition in 98. The property was purchased by Dr Dennis Hart and Ms Julian White in December 2003, and until 06 the grapes were sold to Constellations Kamberra winery. In 07 the crop was completely destroyed by a violent but localised hailstorm, so the first wines were not made until 08. Shiraz and cabernet sauvignon were the initial plantings, and more recently, riesling and pinot gris were added.
