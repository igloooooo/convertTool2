            Andrew and Joyce Horvat began developing their shiraz vineyard in 1995; their children Andrew Jr, Gabriel and Dominik are also involved in the venture. The wines are made using traditional methods and ideas, deriving in part from the familys Croatian background. One of the particular techniques is the use of Croatian oak (Quercus petraea) barrels, the wood apparently contributing soft tannins to the wine. Exports to China.
