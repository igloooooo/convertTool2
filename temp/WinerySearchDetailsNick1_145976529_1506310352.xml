            Hares Chase is the creation of two families who own a 100-year-old vineyard in the Marananga Valley area of the Barossa Valley. The simple, functional winery sits at the top of a rocky hill in the centre of the vineyard, which has some of the best red soil available for dry-grown viticulture. The winemaking arm of the partnership is provided by Peter Taylor, former Southcorp group red winemaker, with over 30 vintages experience. No wines were tasted for the 2013 edition, the rating is that of last year. Exports to the US, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and China.
