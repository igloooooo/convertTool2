            In turning their dream into reality, Graeme Davies (an educational psychologist) and wife Helen (a chartered accountant) took no chances. After becoming interested in wine as consumers through wine appreciation courses, the Davies moved from Brisbane so that 36-year-old Graeme could begin his study for a postgraduate diploma in wine from Roseworthy. Late in 1993 they purchased a 5ha property near Lake Cathie, progressively establishing chardonnay, verdelho, muscat a petit grains, cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo and chambourcin. As well as having a full-time job at Cassegrain and establishing the vineyard, Graeme built the house, which was designed by Helen and has a pyramid-shaped roof and an underground cellar.
