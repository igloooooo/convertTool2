            Ralph and Margaret Judd purchased the property in 1989 with a view to growing shiraz for Southcorp. Shiraz and durif were selected for wine production, with experimental plantings of zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, nebbiolo, tempranillo and sangiovese. The arrangement with Southcorp ended in 2004, and since that time the production has been sold under the Judds Warby Range Estate, or sold in bulk.
