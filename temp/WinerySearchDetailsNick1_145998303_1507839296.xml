            Former Victorians Trevor and Carol Sharp purchased their 29ha property at Severnlea in 2002. They have planted shiraz (1.6ha), black muscat (1.4ha), chardonnay (0.6ha), merlot (0.5ha) and a few vines of cabernet sauvignon; all of the vines are dry-grown. The cellar door has great views of the surrounding country, and complements the stone B&amp;B accommodation.
