            Has a low profile, selling its wines locally, but deserves a far wider audience. The initial releases were made at Bests, but since 1992 all wines have been made on the property by Rod Barrett, emulating John Thomson at Crawford River Wines. The vineyard is planted to riesling (2ha) and pinot noir (2.5ha).
