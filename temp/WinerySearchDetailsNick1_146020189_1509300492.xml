            Seplin Estate was established by the late Seppi Widauer and wife Lindy. It was the culmination of a long-held ambition to have their own wines and their own cellar door. When Seppi died suddenly in March 2004, his wife and children (Jamie and Simon) decided to continue the project, opening the cellar door and function centre in April 06. It is situated in a 70-year-old building overlooking the nearby lagoon and gum trees. Most of the wine comes from 5.2ha of shiraz and 4.6ha of chardonnay, supplemented by some purchases of cabernet sauvignon.
