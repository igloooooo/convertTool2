            A very prominent vineyard on Maddens Lane, with chardonnay (23ha), pinot noir (13ha and sauvignon blanc (7ha). With the arrival of Dominique Portet (also on Maddens Lane), Yarrawalla has ventured into winemaking under its own label, although the major part of the production continues to be sold as grapes.
