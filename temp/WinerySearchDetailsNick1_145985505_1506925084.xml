            Brian and Colleen Marsh modestly describe themselves as little more than hobbyists, but also admit that our wines show tremendous promise. They began planting the vineyards in 1993 in a hidden valley at the foot of Kenilworth Bluff, and now have 4ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, semillon and chardonnay. Presently the wines are made offsite, but the Marshes hope to establish their own winery.
