            Geoff and Sue Duke run a tiny, low-key winery with a 1.6ha vineyard equally divided between chardonnay and pinot noir. Its establishment goes back to 1989; 94 marked the first commercial Chardonnay and 97 the first Pinot Noir. The wines are made in an onsite micro-winery and back vintages are available; the wines are sold when they are two years old.
