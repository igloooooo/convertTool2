            Barry and Jan Morey keep a low profile, but the wines from their vineyard at Beechworth have a cult following not far removed from that of Giaconda; chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, semillon, pinot noir, merlot, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and gamay are the principal varieties planted on the north-facing, granitic slopes. Gamay and Chardonnay are the winery specialties. Exports to Japan.
