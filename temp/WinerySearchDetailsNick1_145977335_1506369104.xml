            Hay River first appeared in my Wines and Wineries of Western Australia, published in 1982. The then very remote vineyard was planted in 1974, and I visited the tractor shed-cum-winery with diesel engine-generated power, watching Jane Paul make the 1981 vintage (which turned out very well). These days the grapes from the 6ha of cabernet sauvignon and 5ha of chardonnay are sold to Howard Park, but a small amount of wine is made for release under the Hay River label.
