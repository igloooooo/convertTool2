            The change of accent from Veritas to Rolf Binder came with the 50th anniversary of the winery, established by the parents of Rolf and sister Christa Deans. The growth in production and sales is due to the quality of the wines rather than the (hitherto) rather laid-back approach to marketing. The winery produces a full range of all the main white and red wines sourced from the Barossa and Eden valleys. It has had conspicuous success with Semillon at the Barossa Valley Wine Show, but the red wines are equally commendable. Exports to all major markets.
