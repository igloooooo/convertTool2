            Roger Pike says he has loved wine for over 30 years; that for 15 years he has had the desire to add a little bit to the world of wine; and that over a decade ago he decided to do something about it, ripping the front paddock and planting shiraz in 1994. He sold the grapes from the 199799 vintages, but when the 98 vintage became a single vineyard wine (made by the purchaser of the grapes), selling in the US at $40, the temptation to make his own wine became irresistible. No wines were made in 2009 due to the impact of the short heatwave at a critical point in the middle of veraison. Rather than compromise with a second label, he decided to skip the vintage altogether, and was richly rewarded with an array of high quality wines from 10.
