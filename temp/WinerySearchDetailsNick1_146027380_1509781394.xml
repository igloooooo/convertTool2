            The Tait family has been involved in the wine industry in the Barossa for over 100 years, making not wine but barrels. Their more recent venture into winemaking was immediately successful. Their estate vineyards (3ha of shiraz and 2ha of 80-year-old cabernet sauvignon) is supplemented by contract-grown grapes. Winemaker Bruno Tait works with wife Michelle and brother Michael looking after various facets of the business. Exports to the US, Canada, Israel and Singapore.
