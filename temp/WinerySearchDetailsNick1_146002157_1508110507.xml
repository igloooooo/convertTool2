            This business is owned by Mike and Bridget Jansz, and before anyone takes offence at the name or label, the naked womans figure is very similar to the mountain range to the northwest of the vineyard. Moreover, the female images on the second label, Duet, represent Mike and Bridgets two daughters. The most significant development since the vineyard was first planted in 1996 has been the recent erection of an onsite winery, where all the wines are now made. Organic certification was commenced in 2007, and since 09 all estate wines carry the NASAA organic certification logo. Exports to Indonesia and Thailand.
