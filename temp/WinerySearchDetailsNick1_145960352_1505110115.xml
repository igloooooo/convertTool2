            Owners Will Finlayson and Simon Greenleaf met 16 years ago while both working at Petaluma. A long-term plan to make their own wine came after Simon had done vintages in France, Chile and Spain, and Will in Oregon. In 1998 Simons parents bought a 7ha property, at which time it was completely overgrown with blackberries. Will says, We had limited funds so we did it all ourselves, from clearing the land to growing the cuttings and eventually putting the posts in  it took months of work. Two varieties were planted first: pinot noir, using Burgundy clones 114 and 115; and pinot gris, followed by sauvignon blanc and chardonnay.
