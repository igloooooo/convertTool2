            Kevin Watson completed his wine science degree at CSU, and the primary purpose of his business is custom winemaking for the many small growers in the region, including all the clients of Peter Scudamore-Smith MW. In 2001, the Marburg Custom Crush company developed a state-of-the-art winery (as the clich goes), cellar door and restaurant. $500 000 in government funding, local business investment and significant investment from China provided the funds, and the complex opened in 2002. Since then, the business has expanded further with a public share raising. The own-brand Warrego wines come from grapes purchased in various regions, and a tiny amount of estate-grown viognier (0.2ha). Part proceeds from each bottle sold goes to the Australian Koala Foundation. Warrego is Qlds only certified organic winery. Exports to Canada.
