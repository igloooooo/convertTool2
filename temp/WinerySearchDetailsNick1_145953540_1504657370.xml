            This is the venture of Meegan and Rob Peebles, which comes on the back of Robs 15-plus-year involvement in the wine industry, including six vintages in Rutherglen, starting in 1993, followed by 10 years at Domaine Chandon, and squeezing in weekend work at Coldstream Hills cellar door in 93. It is the soils of Heathcote, and a long-time friendship with John and Jenny Davies, that sees the flagship Shiraz, and a smaller amount of Zinfandel (with some shiraz) coming from a small block, part of a 40ha vineyard owned by the Davies just to the southwest of Colbinabbin. The wines are made by Rob at Domaine Chandon. Exports to the US.
