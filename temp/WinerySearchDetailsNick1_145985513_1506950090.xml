            Jack Rabbit vineyard is the reincarnation of Kilgour Estate following its acquisition by David and Lyndsay Sharp of Leura Park Estate. Its 2ha of vineyards (planted equally to pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon), take second place to its restaurant and event facilities, the restaurant open for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights, but available for special events. Fruit from the estate vineyards is supplemented by contract-grown fruit, and production has increased sharply, each of the six wines winning at least one wine show award in 2011, gold medals to the Chardonnay 10 and Sauvignon Blanc 11 at the Concours des Vins du Victoria 11 heading the field. Unusual one price fits all approach for a small winery.
