            Owners Charles and Alison Hewitt live in England and entrust the care of the property and vineyard to Alisons father Peter Brown, with support from former Parks &amp; Wildlife ranger Val Dell. A love of red burgundy and fishing was sufficient for Charles to establish the vineyard planted to three clones of pinot noir in Tasmania, where Alison had spent most of her formative years. The vineyard is on a north-facing slope overlooking the DEntrecasteaux Channel. Exports to the UK.
