            Hills of Plenty is just outside the Melbourne metropolitan area, north of Greensborough. Owner/winemaker Karen Coulston has a tiny vineyard of riesling, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon around the winery, but most of the fruit is purchased from other regions, notably Geelong, Gippsland and Swan Hill. The limited production means that the cellar door only opens once a month, but these are festive occasions, with live music, and picnics welcome.
