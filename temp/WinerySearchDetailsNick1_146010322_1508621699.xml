            The Pipers Brook Tasmanian empire has 185ha of vineyard supporting the Pipers Brook and Ninth Island labels, with the major focus, of course, being on Pipers Brook. Fastidious viticulture and winemaking, immaculate packaging and enterprising marketing create a potent and effective blend. Pipers Brook operates two cellar door outlets, one at headquarters, the other at Strathlyn. In 2001 it was acquired by Belgian-owned sheepskin business Kreglinger, which has also established a large winery and vineyard at Mount Benson in SA (Norfolk Rise, see separate entry). Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
