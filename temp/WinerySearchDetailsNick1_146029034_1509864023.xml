            TeAro Estate is a family-owned and operated wine business located in Williamstown in the southern Barossa Valley. In 1919 great-grandfather Charlie Fromm married Minnie Kappler, who named their home block TeAro. They planted shiraz and semillon, their only equipment a single crowbar (and their bare hands). Under the guidance of second- and third-generation family members Ron and Trevor, the vineyard has grown to just over 58 ha. Until 2001 the grapes were sold, but in that year Trevor decided to have a tonne of shiraz made for the local football club. It has been the fourth generation, including vigneron Ryan Fromm and brother-in-law Todd Rowett, that has been responsible for the proliferation of varieties. The vineyards are planted (in descending size) to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, semillon, chardonnay, pinot noir, riesling, viognier, sauvignon blanc, pinot gris, tempranillo, merlot, mourvedre and grenache. Exports to China and Hong Kong.
