            John Gilbert has a number of brands, led by Gilberts Siding with a flagship Erebus Shiraz and Earhart Cabernet from McLaren Vale, supported by Sangiovese Shiraz and a Grenache Shiraz. His Jardim do Bomfim wines come from the Thunderbird Vineyard at Middleton (Fleurieu Peninsula), Ironstone Ridge Vineyard in the Adelaide Hills (planted to Italian varieties, including a direct importation of a Sicilian white grillo brought in after the 2001 vintage), and the dry-grown XR-65 Vineyard at Langhorne Creek.
