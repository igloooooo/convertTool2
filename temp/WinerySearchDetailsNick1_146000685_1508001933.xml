            This is the venture of Tim Adams and wife Pam Goldsack, the name chosen to honour KH (Mick) Knappstein, a legend both in the Clare Valley and the broader Australian wine community. Adams worked at Leasingham Wines with Mick between 1975 and 86, and knew him very well. When Tim and Pam acquired the Leasingham winery in January 2011, together with its historic buildings, it brought the wheel full circle. Various commentators (including myself) have used Micks great one-liner There are only two types of people in the world: those who were born in Clare, and those who wished they had been. This is a separate business from the eponymous Tim Adams Wines. Exports to China.
