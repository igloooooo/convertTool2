            With a talent for sourcing exceptional old vine fruit from the Barossa floor,Tim Smith has created a small but credible portfolio of wines, currently including Mataro, Grenache, Shiraz, Viognier,and more recently Eden Valley Riesling. Tim left his full-time winemaking role with a large Barossa brand in 2011, allowing him to concentrate 100% of his energy on his own brand. In 12 Tim joined forces with the team from First Drop (see separate entry), and has moved winemaking operations to a brand-new winery fondly named Home of the Brave in Nuriootpa. Exports to the UK, Denmark, Taiwan and Singapore.
