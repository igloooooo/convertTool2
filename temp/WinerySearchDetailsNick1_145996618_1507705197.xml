            The Richards family, having bred Angus cattle for decades, diversified (in a small way) into grapegrowing in 1993. The vineyard has been planted on a northeast-facing slope on red volcanic clay loam, which is free-draining and moderately fertile. There are 2ha of chardonnay, 0.5ha of pinot noir and 0.25ha of gewurztraminer. A full suite of wines is made, including a bottle-fermented Blanc de Blancs, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Gewurztraminer and Pinot Noir Rose.
