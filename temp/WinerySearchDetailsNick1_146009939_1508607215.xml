            The derivation of the name remains a mystery to me; if it is a local landmark, I have not heard of it. It sources its grapes from a wide variety of places, to make a range of wines that are well outside the straight and narrow. Piggs Peake has secured listings at a number of leading Sydney metropolitan and NSW country restaurants. The annual production sells out within months of release each year, a testament to the quality of the wines. Exports to Denmark.
