            In 2002 the 10ha Cooyal Grove property of vines, pistachio nut trees and olives was purchased by Sydney publican John Lenard, and Paul and Lydele Walker, a local Mudgee vigneron and his wife. The partners say, We have worked almost every weekend in the vineyard and grove, undertaking every task from planting, pruning, training, harvesting, bottling and labelling. Given that all of the partners are only 30 years old and not yet financially able to employ outside labour, we seem to call on every friend, relative and friends relatives to assist. This has made for a feeling of building something from scratch which we are proud of. The vineyards now include 0.5ha each of chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon blanc, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon.
