            This is the venture of brothers Nick and Tim Stock, both of whom have had a varied background in the wine industry (primarily at the marketing end, whether as sommeliers or in wholesale) and both of whom have excellent palates. Their contacts have allowed them to source single vineyard Rieslings from Sevenhill in the Clare and Eden valleys, a single vineyard Shiraz from Heathcote, and an Eden Vineyard Riesling. As one might expect, the quality of the wines is excellent.
