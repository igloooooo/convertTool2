            Kamberra was part of the Hardys group, established in 2000 with the planting of 40 ha of vines and a winery in the ACT, only a few hundred metres from the showground facilities where the National Wine Show is held every year. Riesling and Shiraz are fully estate-grown, and most of the wines have a Kamberra component. In March â€™07 Kamberra was sold to a Canberra company, part of the Elvin Group, leaving the business intact.
