            Colin and Rosa Mitchell commenced the development of Yandoit Hill with the first plantings in 1988 with merlot, and a little under a ha each of cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon followed by 0.5ha each of arneis (the first planting in Australia), and nebbiolo in 95. The vineyard is 20km north of Daylesford, roughly halfway from Ballarat to Bendigo and, although situated on the north-facing slope of Yandoit Hill, is in an uncompromisingly cool climate. Due (presumably) to the combined impact of drought and smoke taint, no wine was made in 2007.
