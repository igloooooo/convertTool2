            Barrymore Estate is part of a much larger property first settled in the 1840s; the abundance of water and wetlands, with the confluence of the Devil Bend and Balcombe Creeks nearby, has sustained grazing and farming since the first settlement. Peter Cotter has planted 8.5ha of pinot noir, 1ha each of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and 0.5ha of pinot gris, selling part of the grapes and making part under the Barrymore label.
