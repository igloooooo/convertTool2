            Two Way Range is owned by Seabrook &amp; Clancy Wine Co., and is a joint venture between the Seabrook and Clancy families. Ian and Wendy Seabrook are part of the celebrated Melbourne Seabrook wine family, while Paul and Fran Clancy are retired wine industry book publishers who have run a historic vineyard on the upper reaches of Jacobs Creek at Krondorf for nearly 20 years. The vineyard has a gilt-edged list of purchasers, including?Rockford, John Duval, Spinifex, Charlie Melton and Massena Wines. The exceptionally high quality of the grapes is thought to be due to the very young soils (200 000 years) originating high on Kaiser Stuhl hill, and the cold gully winds from the adjacent Eden Valley. Ian and Paul are both Vietnam veterans, and two way range was an expression of black humour when Australians went out on patrol: akin to a rifle range where the targets shoot back. The wine is matured in a mix of new and used French oak for 18 months. Exports to Singapore, Hong Kong and China.
