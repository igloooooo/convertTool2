            Anthony and Gary Whaite began the planting of their vineyard in 1975 with cabernet sauvignon and shiraz and have slowly expanded it over the following years with merlot, mourvedre and grenache. The vines are dry-grown, and the whole operation from vine to wine is carried out by the pair. They use traditional small-batch winemaking techniques of open fermenters, which are hand-plunged, basket-pressed, etc.
