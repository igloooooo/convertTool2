            While nominally situated at Bicheno on the east coast, Apsley Gorge is in fact some distance inland, taking its name from a mountain pass. Clearly, it shares with the other east coast wineries the capacity to produce Chardonnay and Pinot Noir of excellent quality. Brian Franklin travels to Burgundy each year for the vintage, putting into practice at Apsley Gorge what he learns in Burgundy.
