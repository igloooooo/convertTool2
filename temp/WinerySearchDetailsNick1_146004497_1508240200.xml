            Bruce and Judy McLeod progressively established a micro-vineyard of chambourcin, verdelho, malbec, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon between 1998 and 2004. It is situated on a north-facing slope, with sweeping views of the Cambewarra Mountains, and all the wine is sold through the adjacent cellar door, by mail order and through a handful of local outlets. The quaintly named BTU Road, incidentally, runs off the Princes Highway south of Nowra, and leads to the HMAS Albatross Base. In 2005 the business was purchased by Mark and Nikki Reminis.
