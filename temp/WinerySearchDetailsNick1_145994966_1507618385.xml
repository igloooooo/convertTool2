            Lachlan and Gerda McKinnon purchased Parkside in 2004; the 65-ha property was primarily used for thoroughbred agistment, but included a rundown 2-ha vineyard. It also had a grand, fully restored 120-year-old house, now home to the McKinnons. The first year was spent rehabilitating the vineyard, the second converting the dairy on the property into a winery under the direction of winemaker Brian Wilson. The sauvignon blanc, chardonnay and pinot noir all show considerable promise, but the McKinnons would be the first to admit they are on a sharp learning curve, with much more to show in the future.
