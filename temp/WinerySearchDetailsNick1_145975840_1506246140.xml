            In 1856 the Mader family, driven by religious persecution, left Germany to settle in SA, acquiring a 25ha property at Light Pass. Over the generations, farming and fruit growing gave way to 100% grapegrowing; six generations later, Mark Mader produced the first wine under the Gumpara label, in 2000. After success with Shiraz, Mark branched out into Semillon made from a small parcel of almost 90-year-old estate vines. It was judged the top wine in its class in the Barossa Wine Show of that year. The portfolio may be small, but its certainly diverse, with a Vermentino made in 09 and a range of fortified wines, (Tawny Grenache, Liqueur Semillon and Liqueur Frontignac) made by Mark personally. Exports to Singapore.
