            Vitto Oles and Candi Westney run this tiny, cool climate vineyard situated at the southern end of the Strathbogie Ranges, which in fact falls in the Upper Goulburn region. They have planted 1.6ha of shiraz and 0.4ha of viognier, growing the vines with minimal irrigation and preferring organic and biodynamic soil treatments. Vitto is also a fine furniture designer and maker, with a studio at Rocky Passes.
