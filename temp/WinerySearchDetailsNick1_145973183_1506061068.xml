            GlenAyr intends to carry on, and indeed expand, its production in the wake of the sale of the Tolpuddle Vineyard to Shaw &amp; Smith in 2011. It has retained its original vineyard (planted in 1975), with chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet merlot and riesling. GlenAyr also has the enviable distinction of selling half of the shiraz that won the Jimmy Watson Trophy 11 to Glaetzer-Dixon Wines for their Mon Pere label.
