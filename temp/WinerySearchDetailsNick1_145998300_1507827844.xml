            This small family-owned and operated vineyard is located on a 17.1ha property in the Pyrenees region. Rod Chivers and his family have slowly established their vineyard with 1ha of shiraz, 0.5ha of merlot and 0.25ha of cabernet sauvignon planted on the red clay soils intermingled with quartz typical of the region.
