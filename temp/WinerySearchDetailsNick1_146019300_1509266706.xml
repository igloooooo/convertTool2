            Paul Scorpo has a background as a horticulturist/landscape architect, working on major projects ranging from private gardens to golf courses in Australia, Europe and Asia. His family has a love of food, wine and gardens, all of which led to them buying a derelict apple and cherry orchard on gentle rolling hills between Port Phillip and Westernport bays. Part of a ridge system that climbs up to Red Hill, it offers north and northeast-facing slopes on red-brown, clay loam soils. They have established pinot gris (4.84ha), pinot noir (2.8ha), chardonnay (1ha) and shiraz (1ha). Exports to Singapore and Hong Kong.
