            Molly Morgan has been acquired by Andrew and Hady Simon, who established the Camperdown Cellars Group in 1971, which became the largest retailer in Australia, before moving on to other pursuits. They have been joined by Grant Breen, their former general manager at Camperdown Cellars. The property includes unirrigated semillon vines over 40 years old (used for the Old Vines Semillon), 2ha of chardonnay, 3.7ha shiraz and a few riesling vines.
