            When Mario Toniolo retired, aged 70, and purchased a property on the hills of Main Ridge, he had ideas for a yabby farm and a few cattle on what was an abandoned apple orchard. His Italian blood got the better of him, and he now has over 5ha of pinot noir, pinot grigio and chardonnay, and a 1.8ha olive grove. In late 2009 Michael Kyberd, after over a decade with Red Hill Estate, took over the reins as vineyard manager/winemaker.
