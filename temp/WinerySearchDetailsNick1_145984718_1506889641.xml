            Ian and Gail McMahon purchased the property which was to become Karrak Estate in 1999, planting shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Both had had some experience in vineyard establishment and, likewise, winemaking. Gail backed up with a boutique winemaking course and, with a few hiccups, the business was underway. The problems of marauding kangaroos (kangaroo fences) and birds (netting) finally dealt with, the first wine was made in 2002, and sold out quickly. It continues to be a family and friends business, with all winemaking and bottling done in the small onsite winery. It takes its name from the red-tailed cockatoos that come to drink in the dam late each afternoon, which were called karraks by the local Aboriginal people.
