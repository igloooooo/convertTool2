            Sandra and Guy Vinden have a beautiful home and cellar door, landscaped gardens and a vineyard that includes shiraz (2.5ha), merlot and alicante bouschet (2ha each), with the Brokenback mountain range in the distance. The winemaking is done onsite, using estate-grown red grapes; semillon and chardonnay are purchased from other growers. The reds are open-fermented, hand-plunged and basket-pressed.
