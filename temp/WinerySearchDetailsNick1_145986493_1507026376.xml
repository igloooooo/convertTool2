            Mark Day and Anna Koltunow released their first wine in 1995, using grapes from the Bottin Vineyard in McLaren Vale. Mark Day had worked as winemaker at Maxwell Wines and Wirra Wirra in McLaren Vale, and has been a Flying Winemaker for six consecutive vintages in Europe. Day and Koltunow decided to specialise in Shiraz and Shiraz blends from the McLaren Vale region, but added Sangiovese and Mourvedre to the mix in 2002. Exports to the UK and the US.
