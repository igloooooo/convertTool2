            Loom Wine is a family-operated wine business located in Mc LarenVale. It makes wines under two labels: the widely distributed Loom Wine range, now made by Jess Hardy, and the cellar door-only wines of Stamford &amp; Clark,which are made by owner Steve Grimley. All wines are made onsite in a recently completed small batch winery. In addition to managing the Loom Wine business, Steve consults to UK-based Direct Wines (the largest direct marketer of wine in the world) and is in charge of making and sourcing their Australian range. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
