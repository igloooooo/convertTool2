            The Aventine vineyard is situated at an elevation of 1000 m, on a north-facing hill high above the Ballandean Valley. The vines have established on shallow, weathered granite, with equal size plantings of chardonnay, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and muscat. All the wines are made from estate-grown grapes.
