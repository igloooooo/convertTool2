            David and Nicky Shelton are vineyard holders within the 80ha Margaret River Vineyards Estate in Clews Road, Cowaramup. The Estate is a relatively rare example of so-called clos farming being an unqualified success, with a generally high level of viticulture throughout (under the control of Ian Davies). The name Calem is a combination of the Sheltons childrens names, Cal and Emma. The vineyard was planted in 1996, and the first vintage was 00.
