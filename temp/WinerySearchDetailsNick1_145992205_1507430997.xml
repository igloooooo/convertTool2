            This is the ultimate organic winery, with no sprays whatsoever being used in the vineyard, and no chemicals  and in particular, no sulphur dioxide  added to the wines. No oak is used, nor are the wines filtered. Chambourcin is, and always will be, the most important grape, its hybrid heritage making it resistant to most of the moulds that require spraying. The absence of SO2 in the wine means early consumption is essential.
