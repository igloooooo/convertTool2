            The Hairy Arm is a name and label not easy to forget, so marketing experts will surely applaud. Steven and Natalie Worleys business may be small, but it certainly meets a marketing mantra. Steven graduated as an exploration geologist with a Master of Geology degree, followed by a postgraduate Diploma in Oenology and Viticulture. Until December 2009 he was general manager of Galli Estate Winery, The Hairy Arm Wine Company having started as a university project in 04. It has grown from a labour of love to a semi-commercial undertaking, focusing exclusively on shiraz grown variously in the Heathcote, Sunbury, Upper Goulburn Valley and Yarra Valley regions. The hairy arm, incidentally, is Stevens.
