            Otway Estate dates back to 1983 when the first vines were planted by Stuart and Eileen Walker. The current group of six family and friends have expanded the scope of the business: the vineyard is planted primarily to chardonnay (3ha) and pinot noir (1ha) with small patches of riesling, semillon, sauvignon blanc and gewurztraminer. The arrival of Ian Deacon as consultant winemaker is a positive turn of events.
