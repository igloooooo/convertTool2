            Within sight of the Snowy Mountains, Tumbarumba Wine Estates Mannus Vineyard was established by a group of Sydney businessmen, all wine enthusiasts, with the aim of producing high quality cool climate wines. The vineyard is currently undergoing some refinement, with some cabernet sauvignon being grafted to more suited varieties (sauvignon blanc and chardonnay). The major part of the production from the 21ha of vineyard (principally chardonnay and sauvignon blanc) is sold to other producers.
