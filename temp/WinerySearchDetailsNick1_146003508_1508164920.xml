            The Newbridge property was purchased by Ian Simpson in 1979 partly for sentimental family history reasons, and partly because of the beauty of the property situated on the banks of the Loddon River. It was not until 1996 that he decided to plant shiraz, and up to and including the 2002 vintage the grapes were sold to several local wineries. He retained the grapes and made wine in 2003, and Ian lived to see that and the following two vintages take shape before his death. The property is now run by his son Andrew, the wines contract-made by Mark Matthews, with enthusiastic support from Andrew.
