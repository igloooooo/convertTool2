            Adrienne and Murray Cousins purchased a 220ha grazing property in 1985; the sheep and Angus cattle remain the principal part of the general farming program, but between 87 and 99 they established pinot noir, chardonnay, cabernet franc and merlot. The quality of the wines has been consistently good, and they are sold through a stone cellar door, as well as at a number of fine wine retailers around Melbourne.
