            History does not relate what Nick Glaetzers high-profile Barossa Valley winemaker relatives thought of his decision to move to Tasmania in 2005, commencing a search for cool-grown, super-premium vineyards to make cutting edge cool climate styles. Obviously wife Sally approves, and Nick has a full-time job as one of the winemakers at Frogmore Creek. While his winemaking career began in the Barossa Valley, he then reached into scattered parts of the New World and Old World alike, working successively in Languedoc, the Pfaltz, Margaret River, Riverland, Sunraysia, Hunter Valley and Burgundy. It is a virtual winery operation, an eminently sensible first step. Exports to Hong Kong.
