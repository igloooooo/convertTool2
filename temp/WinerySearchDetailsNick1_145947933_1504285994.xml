            When Greg and Mell McClure purchased Belvoir Park Estate in November 2010 from founders Ian and Julie Hall, it was in excellent condition. The house, guarded by 200-year-old redgums, overlooks the vineyard gently sloping away from the house, planted to riesling, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. It was very much a lifestyle change for the McClures and their three young children. The one continuing thread has been Gregs involvement in the marketing side of many businesses, evident in the renovation of the cellar door that now includes a gallery for local artists.
