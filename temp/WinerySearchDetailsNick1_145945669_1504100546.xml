            Banca Ridge was an initiative of the Stanthorpe State High School, which has established the first commercial school winery in Qld. It has 0.5ha each of marsanne and merlot, and students are involved in all stages of the grape growing and winemaking process under the direction of Peter Orr. More recently the business has become part of the Queensland College of Wine Tourism, designed to train students in the wine, hospitality and tourism industry, and the wines produced are a credit to the school and the program.
