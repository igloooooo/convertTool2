            Patriarch Jeff Moss began his wine career in 1947, first with Mildara, then the Victorian Government, while simultaneously developing a 20ha vineyard, followed by a five-year stint with Seppelt. In 1978 he and his family moved to WA, where he became vineyard manager for Houghton, part of his job entailing the identification of worthwhile vineyards in the cooler south of the state. The family took its first step in 1984 when it purchased the Caves Road property, commencing planting the following year. With various children involved in differing roles over the years, Moss Brothers has grown, most significantly with the construction of a 400-tonne winery in 92, which processes both estate-grown and purchased grapes for the Moss Brothers label, and provides contract winemaking services. Exports to Germany and Singapore.
