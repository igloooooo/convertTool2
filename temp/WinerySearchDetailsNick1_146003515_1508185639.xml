            Karen Davy and Michael White decided to diversify their primary business of beef cattle production on their 280ha property in 1988. Between then and 2001 they planted a little over 8ha of grapes, initially content to sell the production to other local wineries, but in 01 they retained a small proportion of the grapes for winemaking, increasing it the following year to its current level. In 01 they also purchased a 20ha property overlooking Lake Nillahcootie, on which they have built a strikingly designed restaurant and cellar door.
