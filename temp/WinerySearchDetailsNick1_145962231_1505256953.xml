            Creeks Edge Wines is a redevelopment of an old 43-ha vineyard purchased from Orlando Wyndham by a partnership of American and Australian wine enthusiasts. The oldest vines were planted in 1976, with follow-on plantings in 1988 and a final block of semillon in 1994. The red wines are brought to the onsite barrel store for maturation, with small quantities of super-premium Shiraz and Cabernet made onsite since 2005.
