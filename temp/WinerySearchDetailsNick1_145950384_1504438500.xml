            Dave and Sue Watson purchased their property, situated on the corner of Plains Road and Rogers Road at the base of Sellicks Hill, in 1993. It had 0.8 ha of old shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, a few rows of grenache, and a little over 3 ha of almond trees. In 1995 they removed the trees and planted 3 ha to shiraz and grenache. The grapes from these plantings are sold, the production for Blown Away coming entirely from the old block.
