            Former Fox Creek winemaker Tony Walker has set up Minnow Creek in partnership with William Neubauer; the grapes are grown by Don Lopresti at vineyards just west of Willunga. The name of the venture reflects the intention of the partners to keep the business focused on quality rather than quantity, and to self-distribute much of the wine through the large number of highly regarded Adelaide restaurants. Exports to the US, Canada and Germany.
