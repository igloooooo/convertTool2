            Graeme and Isabel Ross have 1.3ha of merlot, 1.2ha of shiraz and 1.1ha of sauvignon blanc on a north-facing slope. The soil is predominantly grey loam in the merlot and shiraz blocks, with a vein of volcanic red clay loam running through part of the shiraz and most of the sauvignon blanc block; a vein of basalt adds spice to the salt of the sauvignon blanc. Integrated pest management is used in the vineyard (no insecticides) and sprays are held to a minimum.
