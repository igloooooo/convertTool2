            Quarisa Wines was established by John and Josephine Quarisa (and their three children). John has had a distinguished career as a winemaker spanning over 20 years, working for some of Australias largest wineries, including McWilliams, Casella and Nugan Estate. He was also chiefly responsible in 2004 for winning the Jimmy Watson Trophy (Melbourne) and the Stodart Trophy (Adelaide). In a busmans holiday venture, the Quarisas set up a very successful family business using grapes from various parts of NSW and SA, made in leased space. Production has risen from 20 000 dozen in a tough economic environment, value for money part of the success. It is no surprise that leading national distributor Domaine Wine Shippers has taken on the brand. Exports to the UK, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, Israel, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and NZ.
