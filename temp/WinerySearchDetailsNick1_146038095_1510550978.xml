            The Wenzel family left the Hartz Mountains in Germany in 1846 for Australia, and settled in Langhorne Creek in 1853. Six generations later Dale and Lisa Wenzel run two vineyards, with chardonnay, merlot, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot. Most of the grapes are sold to other makers; The Old Mans label is a respectful tribute to Oscar (and Hazel) Wenzel who planted the first vines in 1968.
