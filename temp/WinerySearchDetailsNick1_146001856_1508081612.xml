            Andrew Seppelt has moved with a degree of caution in setting up Murray Street Vineyard, possibly because of inherited wisdom and the business acumen of partner Bill Jahnke, a successful investment banker with Wells Fargo. Andrew is a direct descendant of Benno and Sophia Seppelt, who built Seppeltsfield and set the family company on its path to fame. The partnership has two vineyards, one block at Gomersal, the other at Greenock, with the lions share going to shiraz, followed by grenache, mourvedre, viognier, marsanne, semillon and zinfandel. Most of the grapes are sold, with an increasing amount retained for the Murray Street Vineyard brand. Unusually good point of sale/propaganda material. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Denmark, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
