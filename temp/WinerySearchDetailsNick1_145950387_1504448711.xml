            This is the venture of the brothers Zachopoulos: Nicholas, Michael and Zissis, the last with a double degree  viticulture and wine sciences  from CSU gained in 2009. Brothers Michael and Nicholas manage the 104ha property situated in the Eden Valley at an elevation between 415m and 475m. The majority of the blocks have a north-facing aspect, with some southern and western aspects. The slopes provide good frost protection with their natural air drainage, the soils likewise rich and free-draining. Fifty ha of vineyards have been planted so far to mainstream varieties, with an ongoing planting program extending to 8ha of tempranillo, pinot gris, pinot noir, grenache and mataro. Establishment of the vineyard began in 1998-99, and by far the major proportion of the 450- to 500-tonne grape production is the subject of a sales agreement with Grant Burge up to and including the 2013 vintage. So far 75 tonnes has been retained each year to make the Blue Rock wines.
