            The Argyle Estate vineyard has a rich history. It was once part of a much larger property originally owned by one of SAs viticultural pioneers, John Barton Hack. He grew grapes on his Echunga property in the 1840s, and even sent a sample of his Hock to Queen Victoria, following in the footsteps of Walter Duffield, who had earlier sent Queen Victoria a case of 1844 white, and was promptly prosecuted for making wine without the requisite licence. Re-establishment of the vineyard began in 1999 (by former owner Jock Calder and family), with sauvignon blanc, shiraz and riesling planted. Subsequent plantings have taken the area under vine to its present level. The vineyard was purchased by Paul Freer and Dennis Clift in 2007, with a name change from Cawdor Wines to Argyle Estate. Exports to China.
