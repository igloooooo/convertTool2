            Eric Baker and Sue McKenzie began the development of Pier 10 with the aim of creating first a lifestyle, then perhaps a retirement business. Both helped set up the vineyard while continuing to work in Melbourne before handing over viticultural management to Mark Danaher. Chardonnay, pinot gris and pinot noir are planted.
