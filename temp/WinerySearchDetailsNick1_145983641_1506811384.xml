            Its a long story, but after establishing a very large and very successful herb-producing business in the UK, Rob Frewer and family migrated to Australia in 1997. By a circuitous route they ended up with a property on the Mornington Peninsula, promptly planting pinot noir and chardonnay, then pinot gris, sauvignon blanc and merlot; they have since leased another vineyard at Mt Eliza, and purchased Ermes Estate in 2007. Exports to the UK, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Singapore and Japan.
