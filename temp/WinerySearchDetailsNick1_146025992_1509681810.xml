            Ray and Gail Hicks began the establishment of their vineyard in 1993, extending plantings to a total of 1.5ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir in 96. The tiny production of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Sparkling Macedon is contract-made by various Macedon Ranges winemakers, and the wines are sold by mail order and (by appointment) through the cellar door, which is situated in a heritage stone barn in the vineyard.
