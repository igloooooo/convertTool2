            This long-established family-owned (Michael and John Torresan) business has provided contract bottling services for many years. In 2008 it moved its bottling operation to a new state-of-the-art facility with two bottling lines, one with a capacity of 12 000 bottles per hour, the other 8000 bottles per hour. Winemaking and sales take a back seat.
