            Three legends are involved in the Domaine Epis and Epis &amp; Williams wines, two of them in their own lifetime. They are long-term Essendon guru and former player Alec Epis, who owns the two quite separate vineyards and brands; Stuart Anderson, who directs winemaking, with Alec doing all the hard work; and the late Laurie Williams, the father of viticulture in the Macedon region and the man who established the Flynn &amp; Williams vineyard in 1976. Alec Epis purchased that vineyard from Laurie Williams in 1999, and as a mark of respect (and with Lauries approval) continued to use his name, in conjunction with his own. The Cabernet Sauvignon comes from this vineyard, the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from the vineyard at Woodend, where a small winery was built in 2002.
