            Ewen and Elissa Macpherson purchased what was then an old table grape and orchard property in 1996. In partnership with Ewens parents, Bob and Jill Macpherson, they developed the vineyard, while Ewen completed his Bachelor of Applied Science in viticulture (2003). The vineyard (now much expanded) has been established using state-of-the-art technology; vineyard manager and winemaker Mike Hayes has a degree in viticulture and is a third-generation viticulturist in the Granite Belt region. Symphony Hill is planted to verdelho, viognier, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. It has firmly established its reputation as one of the Granite Belts foremost wineries. Exports to China and Japan.
