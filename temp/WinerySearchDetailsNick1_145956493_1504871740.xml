            The Casuarina Estate property, including restaurant and accommodation, was established by Peter Meier, well known for his cooking abilities at the Rothbury Estate in the 1970s. It is now owned by Ken and Maureen Brittliff, who now run 5-star luxury accommodation with nine fantasy theme suites to complement the restaurant.
