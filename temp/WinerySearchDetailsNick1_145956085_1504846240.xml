            David Freschi graduated with a degree in oenology from Roseworthy College in 1991 and spent most of the decade working in California, Italy and NZ. In 1998 he and his wife decided to trade in the corporate world for a small family-owned winemaking business, with a core of 2.4ha of vines established by his parents in 72; an additional 1.85ha of nebbiolo has now been planted adjacent to the original vineyard. Says David,The names of the wines were chosen to best express the personality of the wines grown in our vineyard, as well as to express our heritage. A second 3.2ha vineyard has subsequently been established in the Adelaide Hills, planted to chardonnay, pinot gris, riesling and gewurztraminer. Exports to Canada and Singapore.
