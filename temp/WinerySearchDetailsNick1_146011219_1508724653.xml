            Darrin and Rebecca Gaffy parted company in 2007 after bring Principia to maturity. Darrin has been winemaker and general manager since, and is more than happy with his lot. The guiding philosophy for Principia is minimal interference, thus the vines (2.7ha of pinot noir and 0.8ha of chardonnay) are not irrigated, and yields are restricted to 1.52 tonnes per acre (3.75 tonnes perha) or less, and all wine movements are by gravity or by gas pressure, which in turn means there is no filtration, and both primary and secondary fermentation are by indigenous yeasts. Principia comes from the word beginnings in Latin: The Principia was Sir Isaac Newtons famous scientific work that incorporated his theory of gravitation and the laws of motion.
