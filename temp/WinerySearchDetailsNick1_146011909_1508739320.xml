            Punt Road has been producing wine for over a decade, and is now under the sole ownership of the Napoleone family. The emphasis is firmly on wines produced from vineyards owned by the family; this has resulted in the introduction of the Airlie Bank range, a sub-$20 Yarra Valley range made in a fruit-driven, lightly oaked style to complement the successful Punt Road range at the premium end of their offerings. There will also be more focus on small-production single vineyard wines in the coming vintages, especially under the Punt Road label. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, China and other major markets.
