            The production gives some guide to the size of the three estate vineyards. The first is the Dwalganup Vineyard in the Blackwood Valley region; the second is St Johns Brook Vineyard in Margaret River; and the third is the Treenbrook Vineyard in Pemberton. Taken together, the three holdings place Barwick in the top 10 wine producers in WA. The wines are released under four labels,The Collectables at the top, from small parcels of estate-grown grapes. Last years rating is maintained in the absence of a representative submission of its wines. Exports to the UK, the US,Canada, Africa, Middle East, Laos and Singapore.
