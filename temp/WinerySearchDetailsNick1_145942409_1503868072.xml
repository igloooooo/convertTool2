            Peter and Wendy Ammitzboll began planting their vineyard in 1995, completing it in 2004. Although the plantings were modest (1.2ha of chardonnay, 0.6ha of pinot noir and 0.2ha of shiraz), their sole intention was to sell the grapes to one of the well-established wineries in the district. Realising there was a wine glut looming, they undertook several years of extension study at CSU, and embarked on winemaking of limited quantities. The Unwooded Chardonnay and Pinot Noir will be supplemented by a sparkling Pinot Chardonnay, Sparkling Rose and Sparkling Shiraz.
