            In 1986 Sue and David Fairlie-Cuninghame purchased a 50ha property on Spring Flat, 6km east of the Mudgee township. It was a weekend retreat, and the main occupation was (and remains) fattening steers. But wine was in their blood: both were founding members of The Rothbury Estate, and Sue was Executive Editor Food &amp; Wine at Vogue Entertaining for over 10 years, adding, I was influenced by many leading winemakers from all over the world, but not one of them ever told me what bloody back-breaking work it is, the discipline required and how dodgy the returns. So it was in 1998 that they planted a shiraz vineyard on their property, using six of the principal clones. The name was chosen because of the uncontrollable vigour of the vines, itself a legacy of the time when a sheepyard had existed where the vines were planted, providing the soil with an inexhaustible supply of nitrogen.
