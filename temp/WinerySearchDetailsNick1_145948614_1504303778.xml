            Bens Run, says owner Norman Marran, is named for our kelpie dog for graciously allowing part of his retirement run to be converted into a showpiece shiraz-only vineyard. Norman was a pioneer of the Australian cotton industry, with a distinguished career as a former director of both the Australian Wheat Board and the Grains Research Corporation, and is currently chairman of a leading food research company. Exports to Japan and Singapore.
