            This is now the full-time business of winemaker Caroline Mooney, who grew up in the Yarra Valley and who has had (other full-time) winemaking jobs in the valley for over 10 years. The focus is on small, single vineyard sites owned by growers committed to producing outstanding grapes. Having worked at the legendary Domaine Jean-Louis Chave in the 2006 vintage, she has a special interest in shiraz and marsanne, both grown from distinct sites on a single vineyard in the Yarra Glen area. There is also a Chardonnay from the upper Yarra Valley, now generally accepted as a perfect environment for the finest of chardonnay styles. Exports to the UK.
