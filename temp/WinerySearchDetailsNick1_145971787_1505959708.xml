            In 1996 Jan and Jorg Gartelmann purchased what was previously the George Hunter Estate  16ha of mature vineyards, most established by Oliver Shaul in 70. A major change in the business model resulted in the sale of the vineyards after the 2006 vintage, and the grapes are now sourced from other Hunter Valley vineyards, giving the business maximum flexibility. Gartelmann also sources grapes grown in the cool Rylstone area in Mudgee. Exports to Germany.
