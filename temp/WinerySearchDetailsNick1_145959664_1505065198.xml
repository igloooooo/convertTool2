            Brian Gaffy married a successful 20-year career in civil engineering with a long-term involvement in the Bundaburra Wine &amp; Food Club in Melbourne. His interest in wine grew, leading to studies at the Dookie Agricultural College, with particular input from Denise Miller. He has planted a vineyard on the rolling hills of the Strzelecki Range to sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir and a mixed block of shiraz/merlot/cabernet.
