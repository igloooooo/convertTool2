            Owned by David and Peg Woods, Karatta Wines is named after Karatta House, one of Robes well-known heritage-listed icons. Built in 1858, Karatta House was occupied by the South Australian Governor Sir James Fergusson during the summers of 1868 to 71. Vineyards include the 12 Mile Vineyard and Tenison Vineyard, both located in the Robe region.
