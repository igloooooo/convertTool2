            This is the venture of Greg and Emma Koch, Greg with a quarter-century of viticultural experience, first in Coonawarra (17 years) and thereafter turning his attention to Wrattonbully, buying land there in 1995 and setting up Terra Rossa Viticultural Management to assist growers across the Limestone Coast. Greg and Emma now have 23ha of cabernet sauvignon and 5ha of pinot gris, and retain the services of the immensely experienced Robin Moody to oversee the making of the Redden Bridge wines at Cape Jaffa Estate.
