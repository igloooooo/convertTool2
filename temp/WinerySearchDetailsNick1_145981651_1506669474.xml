            The property upon which the Inneslake vineyard is established has been in the Charley familys ownership since the turn of the 20th century, but had been planted to vines by a Major Innes in the 1840s. After carrying on logging and fruit growing at various times, the family planted vines in 1988 with the encouragement of John Cassegrain (semillon, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, viognier, pinot noir and pinot gris).
