            Carlo Monichino arrived in Australia from Piedmont, northern Italy, in 1948, and, together with wife Margaret, founded Monichino Wines in 62. Son Terry became involved in the winery early in his life, subsequently obtaining his wine science degree at CSU. He gained added experience visiting wineries in Italy and France, and undertaking a vintage in the Napa Valley. He and his sister Anna now run the winery, although 81-year-old Carlo still makes the fortified wines, winning a trophy at Rutherglen in 2008 for Best Australian Vintage Fortified Red. The table wine range includes Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Semillon, Pinot Grigio, Sangiovese, Barbera, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Durif. The winery has excellent catering facilities, holding many wine dinners and functions, and is a popular tourist destination for a wide range of events.
