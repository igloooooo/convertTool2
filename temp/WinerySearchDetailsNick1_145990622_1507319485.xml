            Dean and Dayna Roberts purchased a vineyard in 2006, which had been planted in 1997 with very close spacing of 1m  1m. They say organic and biodynamic practices are preferred, but not dogmatically pursued. Winemaking is limited to essential interventions. Dean began his career with a viticulture diploma from Swinburne University, Lilydale, in 2002, becoming vineyard manager for Diamond Valley Vineyards, simultaneously undertaking further winemaking studies. He then completed a vintage at Ponzi Wines in Oregon, and on returning to Australia had a short, but intense, period of employment with Bass Phillip. He now works as a vineyard management contractor, and on the winemaking front receives assistance from Dayna, who has a biomedical science degree from Monash University.
