            A latter-day folly of leading Melbourne QC SEK Hulme. He began the planting of 3 ha of chardonnay, 4.3 ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.7 ha of merlot at Arthurs Creek in the mid-1970s, and had wine made by various people for 15 years before deciding to sell any of it. Exports to the UK, the US, Denmark and Japan.
