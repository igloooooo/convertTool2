            If all winery ventures were as simple as this one, Australia would be closing in on 30 000 wineries, not 3000. The partners tell it this way, In early 2007 Daniel Wilson, winemaker, and Chris Bray, wine enthusiast, were enjoying a glass of Barossa Valley Shiraz. Daniel, having crafted many wines from Clare Valley fruit for The Wilson Vineyard, had always wanted to try his hand at a no holds barred Barossa Shiraz. Discussions became serious. The duo met with a number of Barossa growers and visited their vineyards  evaluating, considering, searching for the perfect fruit... and finally, selecting. On 24 February 2010, the first bottle of Tonic Estates 2008 Fountain of Youth Shiraz rolled down the bottling line. The dream had become a reality. And its a terrific wine.
