            Mary and Phillip Broderick are the owners of this long-standing, but small and little-known winery. Its bigger than a hobby, with the wines available for sale, a Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot Petit Verdot tracking the 2.6ha plantings of these varieties. The newer plantings of 1.3ha of clones 777 and MV6 pinot noir are another very different take on his production.
