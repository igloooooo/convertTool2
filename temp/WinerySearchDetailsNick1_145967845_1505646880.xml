            Elliot Rocke Estate has vineyards dating back to 1987 when the property was known as Seldom Seen. Plantings are made up of 9 ha of semillon, 4.3 ha of shiraz and chardonnay, 2.2 ha of merlot and 2 ha each of cabernet sauvignon and traminer, with 0.5 ha of doradillo. The appointment of a new viticulturist has seen lower-yielding vines, a pesticide-free approach, retrellising and pulling out of some of the poorer performing vineyard blocks. The aim is to significantly lift the quality of the wine. Exports to Switzerland, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, China and Japan.
