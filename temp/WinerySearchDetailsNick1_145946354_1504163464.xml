            Owner Jan Siemelink-Allen has over 20 years in the industry, and spent five years in SAs Supreme Court in a successful battle to reclaim ownership of 10ha of cabernet sauvignon and shiraz in Wrattonbully after a joint venture collapsed; it is not hard to imagine the origin of the name. In 2006 she and her family purchased an 8ha vineyard planted to sauvignon blanc and pinot noir near Woodside in the Adelaide Hills, adjoining Shaw &amp; Smiths vineyard. Exports to the UK, Germany, Vietnam, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.
