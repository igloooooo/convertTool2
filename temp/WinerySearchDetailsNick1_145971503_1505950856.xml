            Duje Garbin, winemaker and fisherman from a small island near the Dalmatian coast in the Adriatic Sea, migrated to WA in 1937; in 56 he purchased the Middle Swan property on which Garbin Estate stands. When he retired in the early 1990s, son Peter took over what was a thoroughly traditional small business, and embarked on a massive transition: a new cellar door and processing area, upgraded major plant and equipment, and the establishment of a vineyard in Gingin. A former design draughtsman, Peter is now full-time winemaker, backed up by wife Katrina, assistant winemaker, and sons Joel and Adam. Exports to China.
