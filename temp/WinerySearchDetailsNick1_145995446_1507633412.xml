            Carl and Linda Bahls have 20ha of prime grazing country, but decided on a minor diversification by planting 0.6ha each of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon. While chardonnay was a natural choice of fruit for a cool climate, cabernet sauvignon was a gamble, albeit a calculated one. The gamble was fully justified when the 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon was placed first at the Southern Highlands Wine Show, the result of meticulous work in the vineyard, and the winemaking team of Jonathan Holgate at High Range Vintners (overseen by Nick Bulleid MW).
