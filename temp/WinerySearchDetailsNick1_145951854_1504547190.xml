            It is hard to imagine there would be such an interesting (and inspiring) story behind a vineyard planted between 1998 and 1999 by the husband and wife team of Tony Dunn and Carol Bradley, wishing to get out of growing angora goats and into grapegrowing. The extension of the business into winemaking was totally unplanned, forced on them by the liquidation of Normans in late 2001. With humour, courage and perseverance, they have met obstacles and setbacks which would have caused many to give up, and have produced wines since 2001 which leave no doubt this is a distinguished site capable of producing Shiraz of consistently high quality. Exports to China, Taiwan and Singapore.
