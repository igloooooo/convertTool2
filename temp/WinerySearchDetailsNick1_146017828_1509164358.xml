            Owned and operated by John and Jenny Horgan, Salitage is a showpiece of Pemberton. John had worked and studied under the guidance of Robert Mondavi in California, and also acquired a share in the famous Burgundy winery, La Pousse Dor (with other Aussie investors, all of whom have since sold out). Together with Bill and Sandra Pannells Picardy, it is a bellwether for the reputation of the region. Further wines were received after this the 2013 edition went to print. Exports to Europe, Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and China.
