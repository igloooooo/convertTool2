            The Peacock Hill Vineyard was first planted in 1969 as part of the Rothbury Estate, originally owned by a separate syndicate but then moving under the direct control and ownership of Rothbury. After several further changes of ownership as Rothbury sold many of its vineyards, George Tsiros and Silvi Laumets acquired the 8ha property in 1995.
