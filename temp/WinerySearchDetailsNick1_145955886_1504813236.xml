            Carbunup Crest is owned by the Meares family, with Kris Meares managing the business. Initially it operated as a grapevine rootling nursery, but it has gradually converted to grapegrowing and winemaking. There are two vineyards in Margaret River, at Metricup (cabernet sauvignon, merlot and semillon) and Cowaramup (sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon and merlot). The dry-grown vines produced grapes with excellent flavour, excellence reflected in the wines. Exports to Philippines, Taiwan, China and Japan.
