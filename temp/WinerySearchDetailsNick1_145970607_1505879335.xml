            Fox Creek has made a major impact since coming on-stream late in 1995. It is the venture of the Watts family: Jim (a retired surgeon), wife Helen and son Paul (a viticulturist); and Lyn Roberts. Kristin McLarty (ne Watts) is marketing manager and Georgy Rogers (ne Watts) is cellar door supervisor. Moves are afoot to introduce organic practices in the vineyards, with trials of an organically registered herbicide derived from pine oil for weed control. Although Fox Creek is not organic, they use sustainable vineyard practices, avoiding all systemic chemicals. The wines have enjoyed considerable show success. Exports to all major markets.
