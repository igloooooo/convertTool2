            Owner Mike Fitzpatrick acquired his taste for fine wine while a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University in the 1970s. Returning to Australia he guided Carlton Football Club to two premierships as captain, then established Melbourne-based finance company Squitchy Lane Holdings. The wines of Mount Mary inspired him to look for his own vineyard, and in 1996 he found a vineyard of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon planted in 82 just around the corner from Coldstream Hills and Yarra Yering. Between then and 2003 the grapes were sold to well-known local wineries, but in 04 he began to put in place a team to take the venture through to the next stage, with wines under the Squitchy Lane label, commencing with the 05 vintage, launched in 07. Since 09 the wines have been made at Sticks.
