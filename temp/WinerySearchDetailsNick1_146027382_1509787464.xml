            The Brady Bunch, headed by Frank Brady, acquired Taliondal in 1974 as a family hideaway. Says Frank Brady, 'When in the Hunter, do as the Hunter does', so 1 ha of cabernet sauvignon was planted in 1974, and 1.5 ha of traminer the following year. For many years the family was content to sell the grapes to local vignerons; they now take a small portion of the production and make wine on the property. The Cabernet Sauvignon has been a consistent medal winner at Hunter shows.
