            In 1998 the Cecchini family, having sold their Upper Hunter winery, acquired the 43-ha block on which this business is established. They built a new winery, a restaurant (Arlecchino Trattoria) and a cellar door sales and function area, planting 2.5 ha of sangiovese. In 2005 all of the assets of this venture were sold to James Estate, but Tish Cecchini leased back the winery to enable her to carry on contract winemaking services for others, and to produce the Serenella brand wines for James Estate.
