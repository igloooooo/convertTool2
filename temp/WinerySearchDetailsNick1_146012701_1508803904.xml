            The slightly curious name (which looks decidedly strange in conjunction with Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon) stems from the original intention of Alan and Dianne Ramsay to grow roses on a commercial scale on their property. Frank Cutler, at Western Port Winery, persuaded them to plant wine grapes instead; the plantings comprise pinot noir, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and riesling. They opened their micro-winery in 1999, and have four self- contained units set around their 800-bush rose garden.
