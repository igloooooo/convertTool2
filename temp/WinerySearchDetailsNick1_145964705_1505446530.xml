            Former Macedon vigneron Bruce Dowding, who sold Rochford back in 1998, has returned to the fray. In 2004 he produced a Pinot Noir using predominantly Gippsland fruit (with some Whitlands material) while, from 05, there were two Gippsland wines, a standard and a premium release, the latter a selection of the best barrels. Of the latter he says, It represents my personal preference and, unlike its sibling, is designed to appeal to those who are already familiar with the variety.
