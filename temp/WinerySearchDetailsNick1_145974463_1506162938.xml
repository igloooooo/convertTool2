            Brian and Lee Paterson have 2ha of cabernet sauvignon and 0.5ha of merlot at Redesdale, one of the most southerly vineyards in the Heathcote region. The name comes from the middle names of Brian Patersons grandmother, mother and daughters. The small production is available from a number of local outlets.
