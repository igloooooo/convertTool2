            Eddie McDougalls wine education began with part-time work in restaurants and bars while obtaining a Bachelor of International Business degree. Once he had taken the next step, with a vineyard job at Shadowfax, he went on to complete a postgraduate degree in wine technology and viticulture at the University of Melbourne. Since then he has worked at Giant Steps, Clyde Park, OLeary Walker, Wood Park and the top-rank Barolo producer, Vietti (Italy). As a fascinating twist, he also spends part of the year making wines at 8th Estate Winery in Hong Kong, educating and sharing his philosophy of wine and lifestyle. You dont need to use much imagination in working out where the name came from. Exports to China and Hong Kong.
