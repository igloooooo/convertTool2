            Peter Jorgensen has established 4ha of vines, choosing to include two varieties ignored by all others in the Hunter Valley: mondeuse and durif; the other varieties are the usual semillon, chardonnay, verdelho, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot. If recognised at all, most people will associate mondeuse with Brown Brothers and Northeast Victoria, but it is a rarely propagated yet interesting red varietal. Exports to Asia.
