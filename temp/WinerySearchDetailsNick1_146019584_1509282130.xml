            Hamish Seabrook is the youngest generation of a proud Melbourne wine family once involved in wholesale and retail distribution, and as leading show judges of their respective generations. Hamish, too, is a wine show judge, but was the first to venture into winemaking, working with Bests and Brown Brothers in Vic before moving to SA with wife Joanne. Here they have a small planting of shiraz (recently joined by viognier) but also continue to source small amounts of shiraz from the Barossa and Pyrenees. In 2008 Hamish set up his own winery, on the family property in Vine Vale, having previously made the wines at Dorrien Estate and elsewhere. Exports to the UK and Hong Kong.
