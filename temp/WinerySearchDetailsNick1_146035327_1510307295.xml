            After a lifetime in the retail liquor industry, John and Susan Vale took a busmans retirement by purchasing a grazing property at Balnarring in 1991. After some trial and error the estate plantings are now riesling, gewurztraminer, tempranillo and durif, the intake supplemented by the purchase of chardonnay and pinot gris from local growers. The winery was built in 1997 from stone and mudbrick, and incorporates the cellar door. The Vales have a continuing business, Winemaking Supplies &amp; Services Pty Ltd, a winery supply wholesaler. Daughter Caroline, with a science degree from Melbourne University and a winemaking degree from CSU, has had a varied international and Australian winemaking career. In Dec 2009, she formally opened a contract sparkling wine production facility  Mousse and Bead  in the winery utilising clients estate-grown grapes, estate-grown base wines, or wines sourced from other growers in the region.
