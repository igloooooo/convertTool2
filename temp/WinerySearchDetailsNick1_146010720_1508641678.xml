            Ian and June Delbridge had been breeding cattle on their 36-ha property since the early 1970s before deciding to establish a vineyard in ’98 on the advice of the late Dr John Middleton. They have planted pinot noir, merlot, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon in the distinguished neighbourhood of Mount Mary, Bianchet and Yarra Edge. Grapes from the first two vintages were sold, but in 2003 the decision was taken to make wine under the Plum Hill Vineyard label. The ’06 wines will be on release for some time; the ’07 and ’09 vintages were affected by smoke (as was the case throughout the Yarra Valley) and the grapes from ’08 were sold.
