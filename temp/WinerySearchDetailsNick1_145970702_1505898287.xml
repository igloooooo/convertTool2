            John Frazer has set up a contract sparkling wine business, called the Champagne Shed, although the winemaking is done offsite. He makes the Frazer Woods wines from 2ha of estate-grown shiraz; the white grapes for the pinot chardonnay sparkling are purchased from others. The wines are sold through the Margaret River Wine Cellars and the Witchcliffe Liquor Store.
