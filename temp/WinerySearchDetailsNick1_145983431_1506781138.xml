            Jingalla is a family business, owned and run by Geoff and Nita Clarke and Barry and Shelley Coad, the latter the ever-energetic wine marketer of the business. The hillside vineyards are low-yielding, with the white wines succeeding best, but they also produce some lovely red wines. A partner in The Vintage Wineworx winery, which means it no longer has to rely on contract winemaking. Exports to Taiwan.
