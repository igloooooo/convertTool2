            Richard and Jill Pringle-Jones run a postage stamp-sized vineyard of 0.25ha each of pinot noir and chardonnay, planted on a vine-by-vine basis. When they purchased Hoeyfield in 2004, plantings of chardonnay and pinot noir had spread over 1998, 00, and 02; Richard and Jill added more pinot noir (the new Dijon clone 777) in 04 and 05. Following Richards retirement from sharebroking, Hoeyfield takes up much of his retirement time.
