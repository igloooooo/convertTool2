            The Fratin Brothers Vineyard was planted by Dino and Michael Fratin in 1998, 30 years after their father Serge and uncles Dom and Lino established Mount Langi Ghiran Vineyards (Serge still oversees the vineyard operations). Shiraz cuttings were supplied by Mount Langi Ghiran, and 2ha of shiraz plus 0.5ha each of sangiovese, chardonnay and tempranillo have been planted. The wines are made in shallow, open fermentation tanks and basket-pressed.
