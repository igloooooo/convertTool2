            The Nelson family has established 2ha of chardonnay and pinot noir on an ideal north-facing slope. The low yields, thanks to viticulturist Dean Nelsons meticulous care, produce grapes with intense fruit flavours, but only a tiny amount of wine is made. There are three wines: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Sparkling (Chardonnay/Pinot Noir).
