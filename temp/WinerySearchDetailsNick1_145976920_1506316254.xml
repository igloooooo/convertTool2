            Originally known as Loxley Vineyard, this was the brainchild of Andrew Pattison, live music doyen, and banker Dennis Cartwright. The vision was to have a wine and music venue dedicated to blues, roots and country live music together with the production of high quality wine. After a search, the property, with its great views and breathtaking sunsets, was acquired; around 20 music devotees and wine buffs invested in the venture. The property was renamed Harmony Row after a restructure of the ownership interests (Andrew Pattison having moved on early in the piece). Dennis and Alison Cartwright now manage the property, which offers concerts every Sunday, the music ranging across country, blues, roots, acoustic, folk, jazz and classical styles.
