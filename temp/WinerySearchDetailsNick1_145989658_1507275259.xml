            Angelica and Pieter Hellema have painstakingly developed an 8.5ha vineyard planted to cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, viognier and petit verdot, using organic principles. Correspondingly, in the winery, only a small quantity of SO2 is added. The name Lilliput Wines dates back to the original crown land allotments (which were extremely small) and the presence of a large family headed by James Gullifer (nine of 16 children survived). In the 1870s there was a Lilliput Winery on the other side of the nearby creek.
