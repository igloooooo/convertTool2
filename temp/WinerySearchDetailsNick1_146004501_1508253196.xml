            The estate takes its name from the fact that the first vineyard was situated on the site of the original vine nursery at Red Cliffs. The holdings have since been expanded to plantings on three additional vineyards: Wilga Road, Cottrells Hill Road and Calder. It is owned by four partners, the vineyards planted to with shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, petit verdot, pinot noir, ruby cabernet and viognier. The well-priced wines are usually well made, with greater richness and depth of fruit flavour than most other wines from the region.
