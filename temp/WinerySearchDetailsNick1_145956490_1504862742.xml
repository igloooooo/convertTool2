            Castelli Estate will cause many small winery owners to go green with envy. When Sam Castelli purchased the property in late 2004, he was intending simply to use it as a family holiday destination. But because there was a partly constructed winery he decided to complete the building work and lock the doors. However, wine was in his blood courtesy of his father, who owned a small vineyard in Italys south. The temptation was too much, and in 2007 the winery was commissioned, with 20 tonnes of Great Southern fruit crushed under the Castelli label, with annual increases thereafter. There is room for expansion because the winery actually has a capacity of 500 tonnes, and the underground cellar is fully climate controlled. Fruit is sourced from some of the best vineyards in WA, including the Hadley Hall, Kalgan River,Whispering Hill and Omodei vineyards. These are geographically distributed across WAs southern regions, including Frankland River, Mount Barker, Pemberton and Porongurup.
