            The Mt Samaria Vineyard, with shiraz (1.6ha) and tempranillo (0.8ha) having the lions share, accompanied by a little cabernet and pinot gris, is owned and operated by Judy and Roger Cowan. Plantings took place over an eight-year period, and in the early days the grapes were sold to Delatite until the Cowans ventured into wine production in 1999. Striking labels are a distinct plus, although wombats are not normally welcome visitors in vineyards.
