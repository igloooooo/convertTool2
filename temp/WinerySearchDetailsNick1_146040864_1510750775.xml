            Wirilda Creek has relocated its cellar door and restaurant to a historic bank site in Aldinga; as well as the cellar door proper, it houses a caf, bar, delicatessen and pizzeria. Co-owner Kerry Flanagan (with partner Karen Shertock) has had great experience in the wine and hospitality industries: a Roseworthy graduate (1980), he has inter alia worked at Penfolds, Coriole and Wirra Wirra and also owned the famous Old Salopian Inn for a period. A little under 4ha of McLaren Vale estate vineyards have now been joined by a little over 3ha of vineyards at Antechamber Bay, Kangaroo Island. Exports to the US, Ireland, Germany and Japan.
