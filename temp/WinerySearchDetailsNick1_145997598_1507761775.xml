            Industry veteran Ian MacRae has demonstrated his skill with every type of wine over the decades, ranging from Rose to Chardonnay to full-bodied reds. All have shone under the Miramar label at one time or another; in 2005 there was a marked swing to white wines, with which Ian has always had a special empathy. The majority of the production from the estate vineyard is sold to others, the best being retained for Miramars own use.
