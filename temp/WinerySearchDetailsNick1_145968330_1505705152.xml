            John and Kerry Higgins have established Eurabbie Estate in an 80ha forest property overlooking a 4ha natural lake. Two separate blocks of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot, with a dash of pinot noir, give rise to the Eurabbie Estate range. Since 2004 grapes have been purchased from three small Pyrenees growers to produce the Pyrenees Villages range: Percydale Chardonnay, Percydale Cabernet Franc, Amherst Shiraz, Stuart Mill Shiraz and Avoca Cabernet Sauvignon. The wines are made in a mudbrick winery powered by solar energy.
