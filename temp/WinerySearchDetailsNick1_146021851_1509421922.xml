            Simon Lang practised as a corporate, commercial and tax lawyer before becoming fascinated by the wine industry. His first step was obtaining a masters degree in wine business, and then establishing a virtual winery. With Joanne Irvine as winemaker and mentor, sauvignon blanc was purchased from the Limestone Coast, and shiraz from the Barossa Valley.
