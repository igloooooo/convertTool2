            Peter Logans interest in viticulture dates back to a 10-week course run by Denise Miller (at Dixons Creek in the Yarra Valley) in the early 1990s. This led to further formal studies, and the planting of a classroom vineyard of 500 chardonnay and shiraz vines. A move from Melbourne suburbia to the slopes of Mt Duneed led to the planting of a vineyard, and to the appointment of Lethbridge Wines as winemaker.
