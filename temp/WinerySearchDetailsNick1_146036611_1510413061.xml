            This is the reincarnation (although under the same family ownership) of Halcyon Daze. Founded by Richard and Cheryl Rackley in 1982, it is now owned and run by Dean and Rennae Rackley. The new name comes from the newly built wedding and function venue. The wines made are Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Close-Planted Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and a Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend.
