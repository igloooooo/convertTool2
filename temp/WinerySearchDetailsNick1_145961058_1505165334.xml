            The Condo family, headed by Frank Condo, purchased their Allawah property at Swan Reach on the Murray River in 1981, but it was not until the mid 90s that they established their vineyard, planted predominantly to cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, with small amounts of merlot and chardonnay. The winemaking is simple, designed to keep production costs to a minimum. The major focus of the business is on exports (Singapore, Hong Kong and China), price being the obvious attraction.
