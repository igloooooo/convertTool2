            This is a joint venture between two very influential wine families: De Bortoli and Shelmerdine. The key executives are Stephen Shelmerdine and Steve Webber (and their respective wives). It rests upon the selection and management of specific blocks of vines without regard to cost. Until 2010 the wines all came from the Lusatia Park Vineyard in the Yarra Valley, but in that year a Heathcote Syrah Grenache was made, and, if the opportunity arises, other wines will be added to the portfolio. The name, incidentally, is derived from the 21st letter of the ancient Greek alphabet,symbolising perfect balance and harmony. Its courageous pricing for a new kid on the block, but reflects the confidence the families have in the wines. Exports to the UK and China.
