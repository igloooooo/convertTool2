            Karl and Sue Feddern established a 10ha vineyard near Red Cliffs, giving substance to a love of wine gained during their years as successful restaurateurs. They have planted 4.65ha of shiraz, 2.8ha of colombard and 2ha of cabernet sauvignon, with small amounts of lagrein, barbera and vermentino. Most of the grapes are sold, a small amount retained for the Rossiters label.
