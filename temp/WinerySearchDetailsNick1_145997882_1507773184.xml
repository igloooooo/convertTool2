            Acquired by Petaluma in 1994 (both now part of Lion Nathan), having already put the runs on the board in no uncertain fashion with gifted winemaker Don Lewis (who retired in 2004). Mitchelton, which celebrated its 40th birthday in 09, boasts an array of wines across a broad spectrum of style and price, each carefully aimed at a market niche. In 10 Travis Clydesdale returned to complete a circle that began when his father Mark was appointed Mitcheltons cellar manager 30 years or more ago. Travis recalls riding around catwalks and playing hide and seek between the tanks as a young boy. This is not the only link with Michelton: while recently he has been winemaker at Deep Woods Estate in Margaret River, he spent seven years at Tahbilk before moving to WA, and developed a deep understanding and appreciation of Nagambie regional wine styles. In June 11 Mitchelton changed hands, purchased by Nagambie Wine Corporation (a business owned by the Ryan family), which is no doubt the reason wines were not sent in time for the 2013 edition. Exports to all major markets.
