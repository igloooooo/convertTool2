            Jed and Sue Hart have, in their words, turned the rocky, ironstone soils of Lovers Hill into a 22-acre vineyard over some back-breaking years'. Seven of the 10 ha are planted to shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, with a small amount each of merlot, semillon and chardonnay. Most of the grapes have been and will continue to be sold, but since 2000 the equivalent of 1000 cases of wine have been retained and contract-made. Nonetheless, the Harts main viticultural business (Jed Hart is in aviation) will be grapegrowing.
