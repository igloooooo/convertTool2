            Rex Watson started in the Australian wine industry in 1991 and began growing wine grapes in Coonawarra in 97. In 99 he began planting the most significant modern vineyard development in Coonawarra. In less than five years, this was built into a venture that now controls and manages almost 350ha over three vineyards, all close to the historic township of Coonawarra and well within the Coonawarra GI. Production under the Rex Watson and Coonawarra Premium Vineyards brands continues to rise. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Sweden, Russia, China and NZ.
