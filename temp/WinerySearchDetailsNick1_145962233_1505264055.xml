            The wheel of fortune has turned full circle with son Rollo Crittenden returning to the (new) family wine business established by father Garry in 2003. In so doing, both father and son have severed ties with Dromana Estate, the old family business. For good measure, the Crittendens have taken a lease on a modern winery in Patterson Lakes, approximately 20 mins north of their Dromana property. Capable of handling 200 tonnes of grapes, more than that required by Crittenden Estate, it has enabled Rollo to develop Latitude 38, a contract winemaking business. He was named Young Gun Australian Winemaker of the Year 10. Exports to the UK.
