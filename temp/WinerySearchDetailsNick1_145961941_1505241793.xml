            Hobart surgeon Barry Edwards and wife Cathy have moved from being grapegrowers with only one wine to a portfolio of several wines, while continuing to sell most of their grapes. Craigow has an impressive museum release program; the best are outstanding, while others show the impact of sporadic bottle oxidation (a diminishing problem with each vintage now under screwcap). In 2008 Craigow won the Tasmanian Vineyard of the Year Award. There is a degree of poetic history: the first settler, who arrived in the 1820s, was a Scottish doctor (James Murdoch), who, among other things, grew opium poppies for medical use; by 1872 his descendants were making wine from grapes, gooseberries and cherries. There is some suggestion that the grapes, known then as black cluster, were in all probability pinot noir.
