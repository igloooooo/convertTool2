            KJB Wine Group (formerly Oenotria Vintners) is the venture of Kurt Brill, who began his involvement in the wine industry in 2003, largely through the encouragement of his wife Gillian. He commenced the wine marketing course at the University of Adelaide, but ultimately switched from that to the winemaking degree at CSU. His main business is the distribution company Grace James Fine Wines, but he also runs a virtual winery operation, purchasing chardonnay from the Yarra Valley and cabernet sauvignon from McLaren Vale. Needless to say, he participates as far as possible in the winemaking process. Exports to the UK.
