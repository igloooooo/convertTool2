            Hawley Vineyard overlooks Hawley Beach and northeast to Bass Strait. It is established on a historic 200ha farming property, with Hawley House offering dining and accommodation in a grand style. There are no other vineyards in this unique wine growing region. Three generations of the Houghton family have owned the property since 1948, although it was not until 1988 that flamboyant hotelier Simon opened the property, starting a major wedding and event operation in tandem with the vineyard and onsite winery.
