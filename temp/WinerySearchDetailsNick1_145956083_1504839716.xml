            Nick and Rebecca Diamond followed their hearts when they moved from Sydney to their Hunter Valley property. The vineyard, planted in 1999, consists of 1.5ha of shiraz and 0.5ha of chardonnay. Then there is the small matter of a 10-room boutique hotel. They lay it on the line when they say We are relative novices in the industry, and that includes the hotel, but nine months in as we lurch from one mini disaster to the next, we love it. Incidentally, this business has no connection to The Carriages in the Goulburn Valley (see separate entry).
