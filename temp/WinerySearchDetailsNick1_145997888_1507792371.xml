            The vineyard, planted to semillon, cabernet sauvignon (1.5ha each) and sauvignon blanc (0.5ha), was established by David Hunt in 1978. Originally called Sienna Estate, it has now passed into the ownership of the Rusilas family, which has significantly enhanced its legacy. Exports to Lithuania.
