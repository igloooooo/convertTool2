            Brothers Kevin, Graham and Wayne Rohrlach, with wives Lyn, Lynette and Kaylene, are third-generation owners of prime vineyard land, the first plantings made back in 1930 by their paternal grandfather. Until 2000 the grapes were sold to two leading Barossa wineries, but (in a common story) in that year some of the grapes were retained to make the first vintage of what became Rohrlach Family Wines. In 03 the family received the ultimate local accolade when the Barons of the Barossa gave them the title of Vignerons of the Year.
