            This very successful business took its name from a 19th-century gold mine. It is the venture of the Nugent family, headed by Dr Michael Nugent; son Andrew is a Roseworthy graduate. The family also has a vineyard in the Clare Valley, the latter providing both riesling and shiraz (and olives from 100-year-old wild trees). A state-of-the-art winery and a straw and mud barrel cellar were completed in 2007. The estate plantings (merlot, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, riesling and shiraz) provide only part of the annual crush, the remainder coming from contract growers. In November 2010, a replica Bird in Hand cellar door was opened in Dalian in Chinas northeastern Laioning province, a second following in Yingkou. Exports to all major markets.
