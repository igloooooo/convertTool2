            Brian and Anne Meakins are also owners of Newmans Horseradish, which has been on the SA market for over 80 years. Increasing demand for the horseradish forced a move from Tea Tree Gully to Langhorne Creek in 1985. It wasnt until 1997 that they succumbed to the urging of neighbours and planted shiraz (4.2ha) and cabernet sauvignon (4.6ha), adding 0.5ha each of durif and zinfandel several years later.
