            Lisle Pudney has planted a substantial vineyard with the help of investors. In all there are over 26 ha of pinot noir and 4 ha each of sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, with another 40 ha to be planted. The vineyard is 20 km from the Southern Ocean on ancient flint beds; a million-year-old mollusc found on the property is depicted on the label of the Pinot Noir. Most of the grapes are sold; a small portion is contract-made for the Benarra label, and is of good quality and varietal character.
