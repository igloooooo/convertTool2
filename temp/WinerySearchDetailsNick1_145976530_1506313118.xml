            In 2003 James Kellie, for many years a winemaker with Howard Park, and responsible for the contract making of Harewoods wines since 1998, purchased the estate with his father and sister as partners. Events moved quickly thereafter: a 300-tonne winery was constructed, offering both contract-winemaking services for the Great Southern region and the ability to expand the Harewood range to include subregional wines that demonstrate the differences in style across the region. In January 2010 James, together with wife Careena, purchased his fathers and sisters shares in the business, and are now 100% owners. Exports to the UK, Denmark, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Macau, Singapore, China and Japan.
