            Mistletoe Wines, owned by Ken and Gwen Sloan, can trace its history back to 1909, when a vineyard was planted on what was then called Mistletoe Farm. The Mistletoe Farm brand made a brief appearance in the late 70s. The wines are made onsite by Nick Paterson, who has had significant experience in the Hunter Valley. The quality and consistency of these wines is irreproachable, as is their price. Mistletoe has also been steadily building museum stock for sale, with several years bottle age.
