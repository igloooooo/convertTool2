            Surveyors Hill vineyard is on the slopes of the eponymous hill, at 550680m above sea level. It is an ancient volcano, producing granite-derived, coarse-structured (and hence well-drained) sandy soils of low fertility. This has to be the ultimate patchwork-quilt winery, with 1ha each of chardonnay, shiraz and viognier; 0.5ha each of roussanne, marsanne, aglianico, nero dalpha, mourvedre, grenache, muscadelle, moscato giallo, cabernet franc and riesling; and lesser amounts of semillon, sauvignon blanc, touriga nacional and cabernet sauvignon.
