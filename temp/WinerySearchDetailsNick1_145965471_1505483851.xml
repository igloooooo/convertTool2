            This is the venture of David Carlei, son of Sergio Carlei; the two have worked together for some years, and David is currently studying wine marketing at CSU. His focus is on using organic and/or biodynamic grapes; maceration of white wines on skins for up to 90 days, followed by prolonged lees contact with minimal fining. The reds see a similar process with whole clusters, wild yeast fermentation and prolonged maceration periods with ageing on lees. They are, in short, natural wines, the red wines with more intrinsic quality than most of their peers. Exports to the US, the UK and China.
