            Barbara and Brett Nelson began the development of their vineyard back in 1990, and until 1999 sold all the grapes to other wineries, including Howard Park. While Howard Park continues to receive some grapes, the lion's share of the plantings of the 1.5 ha each of sauvignon blanc, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon, plus 0.5 ha of merlot, is now used for the Nelson Touch label. The name comes from the saying that Admiral Nelson had the 'Nelson touch' when he defeated the French, because everything he did turned to naval gold.
