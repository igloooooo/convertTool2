            John and Lyn Morley progressively established 1.8 ha of vineyard of chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon between 1994 and 2000. The vineyard is at an altitude of 940 m, and was the first in the growing Tenterfield region. Advanced vineyard climatic monitoring systems have been installed, and a winery was built in 2000.
