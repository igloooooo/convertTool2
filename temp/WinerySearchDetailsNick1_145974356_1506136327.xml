            In 1992 Gordon Gordo Parker left the retail wine business in Perth, and headed south to gain winemaking experience, working at Plantagenet Wines, Forest Hill Vineyards, Cape Clairault and Amberley Estate, before spreading his wings by working at Coldstream Hills and Domaine Chandon in the Yarra Valley. He added to this a Flying Winemaker stint in 1998 in the south of France. He returned to work as a winemaker in WA before deciding to set up his own business in early 2005. He leases a 3.8ha vineyard in Geographe, and buys grapes from other vineyards in the Frankland River, Geographe, Margaret River and Mount Barker regions.
