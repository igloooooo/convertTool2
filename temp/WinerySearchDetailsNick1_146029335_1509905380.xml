            Teusner is a partnership between former Torbreck winemaker Kym Teusner and brother-in-law Michael Page, and is typical of the new wave of winemakers determined to protect very old, low-yielding, dry-grown Barossa vines. The winery approach is based on lees ageing, little racking, no fining or filtration, and no new American oak. As each year passes, the consistency, quality (and range) of the wines increases; there must be an end point, but its not easy to guess when, or even if, it will be reached. Eden Valley Cabernet Sauvignon has (just) ended the monopoly of Shiraz and the Rhne Valley varietals. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
