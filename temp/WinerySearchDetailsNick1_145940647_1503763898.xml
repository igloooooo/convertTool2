            Owners Jodie and Hugh Armstrong say, What started out as an idea between friends and family to make something for ourselves to drink at home during the week has blossomed into a quest for something to stand proudly on its own. The grapes are chosen from small sections of three of the vineyards that Jodie manages, and she and Hugh make the wines in garagiste facilities in the Adelaide Hills and McLaren Vale with the support of local oenological talent. Exports to Singapore.
