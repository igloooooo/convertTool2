            Timo Mayer, also winemaker at Gembrook Hill Vineyard, teamed with partner Rhonda Ferguson to establish Mayer Vineyard on the slopes of Mt Toolebewoong, 8km south of Healesville. The steepness of those slopes is presumably celebrated in the name given to the wines (Bloody Hill). There is just under 2.5ha of vineyard, the lions share to pinot noir and smaller amounts of shiraz and chardonnay  all high-density plantings. Mayers winemaking credo is minimal interference and handling, and no filtration.
