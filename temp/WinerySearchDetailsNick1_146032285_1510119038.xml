            In the early 1960s the Ricca family planted table grapes, followed by shiraz and semillon in 6466, which are said to be the oldest vinifera vines in the Granite Belt region. The Tobin family (headed by Adrian and Frances) purchased the vineyard in 2000 and has increased plantings, which now consist of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, tempranillo, semillon, verdelho, chardonnay, muscat sauvignon blanc, with some remaining rows of table grapes. The emphasis has changed towards quality bottled wines, with some success.
