            Joe and Elizabeth Brischetto planted the first vines in 1996, expanding the vineyard to its present size of 12 000 vines (around 8ha) the following year. The winery is at the coastal town of Bargara, 12km from Bundaberg, and offers views of the sea and vineyards from the outdoor tasting area.
