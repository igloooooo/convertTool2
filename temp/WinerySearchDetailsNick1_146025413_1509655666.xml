            After a lifetime in the food and beverage industry, Michael and Meredith McManus have finally made a decisive move to full-time occupation in all aspects of winemaking. They have set up Stomp Winemaking, a contract winemaker designed to keep small and larger parcels of grapes separate through the fermentation and maturation process, thus meeting the needs of boutique wine producers in the Hunter Valley. The addition of their own label, Stomp, is a small but important part of their business; the Chardonnay, Verdelho and Shiraz are made from purchased grapes.
