            The vineyard (then known as Ashworths Hill) was first planted in 1980 to pinot noir, shiraz, pinot meunier and cabernet sauvignon. When purchased by Mark and Gina Morgan, additional plantings increased the area under vine to 4ha (after removal of the shiraz and pinot meunier), with equal amounts of cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and chardonnay. The wines are deliberately made in a light-bodied, easy-access fashion.
