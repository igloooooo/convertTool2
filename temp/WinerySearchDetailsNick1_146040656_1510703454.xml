            After spending three years travelling in Europe (198386), Wayne Beecham returned to Australia to take up a position with what was then Thomas Hardy Wines, specifically to establish the RhineCastle wine distribution in Qld. He studied wine marketing at Roseworthy while working for Hardys, but in 1993 he, wife Julie and daughter Kate decided to move to the Granite Belt to establish Windermere Wines from the ground up. His long service with Hardys stood him in good stead, landing him a cellar position at Hardys Tintara in the 1994 vintage, working with winemaker David OLeary. In typical Australian fashion, Wayne Beecham says they decided on the Granite Belt because, if we were to succeed, we might as well do it in the toughest new region in the industry.
