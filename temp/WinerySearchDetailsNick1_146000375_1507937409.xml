            This is the venture of two families whose involvement in wine extends in an unbroken line back several centuries: the Tsironis family in the Peleponnese, Greece, and the Iannuzzi family in Vallo della Lucania, Italy. Their vineyards are at Broke (the largest), with a smaller vineyard at Pokolbin. The three principal varieties planted are chardonnay, shiraz and semillon, with small amounts of merlot, viognier and chambourcin. Exports to Maldives, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong.
