            Wombat Forest is jointly owned and operated by local couples Brendon and Deidre Lawlor, and David and Elizabeth Nikcevich. They personally planted the 1.2ha of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir between 1997 and '99, and have since expanded the vineyard to 2ha with pinot noir. The partners make the wine in the small onsite winery.
