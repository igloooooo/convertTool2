            The Westphal family began establishing their 9-ha vineyard in 1993, which now has 2 ha each of chardonnay, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, and 1 ha each of semillon, sauvignon blanc and merlot. It is just south of the township of Margaret River, rubbing shoulders with names such as Leeuwin Estate and Devil's Lair. Part of the crop is sold to other makers. Exports to Malaysia.
