            The Jenke family have been growing grapes in the southern Barossa continuously since their arrival from Germany in 1854. Today the fifth and sixth generations farm almost 50ha of prime Barossa vineyards, with sixth-generation Kym Jenke making all wines onsite. The vineyards have an average age of 40 years, with the oldest shiraz dating back to 1926. A rejuvenation of new plantings in the early 90s has strengthened the varietal mix of traditional with new varieties. The cellar door is located in the original settlers cottage built in 1844. Exports to China, Hong Kong and Singapore.
