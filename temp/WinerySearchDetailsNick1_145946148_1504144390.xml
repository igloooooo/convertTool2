            Heather and Ray Bartsch have been grapegrowers for over 20 years; they are descendants of Gottfried Harwig who settled in the Eden Valley in 1860, and have 26ha of vines in the Eden Valley and 12ha at Angaston. Most of the 300 tonnes of annual grape production is sold to others, but a small percentage is made into a modestly priced but wide range of wines.
