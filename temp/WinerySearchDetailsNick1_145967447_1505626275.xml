            Selma Lowther, then fresh from CSU (as a mature-age student) made an impressive debut with her spicy, fresh, crisp Chardonnay, and has continued to make tiny quantities of appealing and sensibly priced wines. Most of the grapes from the estate vineyards are sold; production remains minuscule. There is a rotunda and childrens playground overlooking the vineyard.
