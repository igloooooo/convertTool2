            5 Corners Wines came together in a hurry. Grant and Suzie Leonard came to Mudgee in 2001 for an overnight visit, and promptly fell in love with the region. They purchased a 40-ha property with 5 ha of established vineyard and a small cottage. The property now includes the family's house (5 children and 6 dogs come and go), the original cottage (occupied by the vineyard manager), and plantings which have been increased by a further 3 ha.
