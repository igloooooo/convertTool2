            Garlands is a partnership between Michael and Julie Garland and their vigneron neighbours, Craig and Caroline Drummond and Patrick and Christine Gresswell. Michael Garland came to grapegrowing and winemaking with a varied background (in biological research, computer sales and retail clothing) and now has a CSU degree in oenology. The winery has a capacity of 150 tonnes, and will continue contract-making for other small producers in the region as well as making the wine from the 9.25ha of estate vineyards (planted to shiraz, riesling, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and semillon). Cabernet Franc is the winery speciality. Exports to the UK, Switzerland, Trinidad, Hong Kong and Singapore.
