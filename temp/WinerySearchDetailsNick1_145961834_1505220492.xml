            Owned by Anthony, Rod and Maxinne Sclanders, Cosham has grown significantly from its small base in recent years. The vineyard, planted on an old orchard, consists of chardonnay, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, plus a couple of rows of petit verdot and cabernet franc, established between 1990 and 95. The vines grow in gravelly loam with some clay, but overall in a well-drained soil with good rainfall. The vineyard is managed organically, no synthetic chemicals for canopy management or weed control; and Dacron collars are used around the trunks of the vines instead of insecticides to stop the damaging weevil infestations.
