            Eperosa owner Brett Grocke qualified as a viticulturist in 2001, and, through Grocke Viticulture, consults and provides technical services to over 200ha of vineyards spread across the Barossa Valley, Eden Valley, Adelaide Hills, Riverland, Langhorne Creek and Hindmarsh Valley. He is ideally placed to secure small parcels of grapes of the highest quality, and treats these with traditional, no-frills winemaking methods: destemmed, macerated prior to fermentation, open-fermented, hand-plunged, basket-pressed, then 18 months in used French oak barrels. The wines are of impeccable quality. Wines were received after 2013 Wine Companion went to print.
