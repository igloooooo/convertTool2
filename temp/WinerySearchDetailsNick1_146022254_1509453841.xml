            Six Gates originates from the six entries to the ancient city of Shiraz, and it is thus appropriate that this organically managed vineyard should be predominantly planted to that variety (4ha of cabernet sauvignon make up the balance). While there is a long history of viticulture on the property, the present plantings were established in 1998 on highly suitable soil, with 25cm of loam on 60cm of red clay over well-decayed limestone, providing good drainage and water-holding capacity. Every one of the 18 000 vines is pruned by the vineyard manager, Bruce Wutke, who has spent a long time as a grapegrower. Exports to China.
