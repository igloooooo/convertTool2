            Like so many Italian settlers in the Australian countryside, the De Stefani family has been growing grapes and making wine for its own consumption for over 30 years at its Reedy Creek property in the far north of NSW. What is more, like their compatriots in the King Valley, the familys principal activity until 1993 was growing tobacco, but the continued rationalisation of the tobacco industry prompted the De Stefanis to turn a hobby into a commercial exercise. The vineyard has now been expanded to 8 ha, and an onsite winery has been completed.
