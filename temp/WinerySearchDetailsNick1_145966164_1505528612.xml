            This substantial Hunter Valley producer has suffered more than its share of misfortune over the years, but has risen to the challenges. Winemaker William (Will) Rikard-Bell, badly injured in the winery explosion of 2007, retired prior to the 11 vintage to pursue separate business interests in Orange with wife Kimmy. They parted on good terms, and Draytons was able to secure the services of Andrew Leembruggen as chief winemaker after 13 years with McWilliams Mount Pleasant. Exports to Ireland,Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan and China.
