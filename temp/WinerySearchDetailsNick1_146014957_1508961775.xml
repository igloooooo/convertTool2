            Richard Mills is a member of the family that has farmed in the region for over 50 years. Born in 1976, he was in his 20s when he realised that he wanted to establish a long-term wine business founded on estate-grown grapes. He planted 40ha of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and shiraz, and the business was underway. He retained the services of Bob Shields, arguably the most experienced winemaker in the region, and the first wines were made in 2005. As well as Australian distribution, Rising Dust is exported to Canada, and there are ample grapes available to increase production if the demand for the wines grows.
