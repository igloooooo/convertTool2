            Westgate has been in the Dalkin family ownership since the 1860s, the present owners Bruce and Robyn being the sixth-generation owners of the property, which today focuses on grape production, a small winery and 4-star accommodation. The vineyards have been progressively established since 1969, including a key holding of 12 ha of shiraz (plus 2 ha of riesling). Prior to the 2010 vintage it was decided to discontinue winemaking and sell all the grape production; remaining stocks of the 2006 Shiraz are being sold through the website.
