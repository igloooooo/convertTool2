            Peter and Natalie Whish-Wilson began the establishment of their vineyard in 1998 while they were working in Hong Kong, delegating the management tasks to parents Rosemary and Tony until 2003. Peter and Natalie took a years sabbatical to do the first vintage, with their children aged six and four also involved in tending the vines. The seachange became permanent, Peter completing his winegrowing degree from CSU in 1996. The original vineyard has been extended, and now comprises 1ha each of pinot noir, chardonnay and riesling. Exports to Sweden.
