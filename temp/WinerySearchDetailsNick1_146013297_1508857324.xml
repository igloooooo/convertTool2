            Colin and Clayton Spencer have moved quickly since establishing their business in 2004. Initially using grapes from several regions, they now only use Yarra Valley fruit, and likewise only use the Redbox label. The estate plantings are of 2ha of cabernet sauvignon, 0.8ha of chardonnay and 0.4ha of riesling, with an additional 0.8ha of cabernet sauvignon offsite.
