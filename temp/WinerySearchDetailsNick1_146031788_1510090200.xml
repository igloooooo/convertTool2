            Three generations of the Tinkler family have been involved with the property since 1942. Originally a beef and dairy farm, vines have been both pulled out and replanted at various stages, and part of the adjoining 80-year-old Ben Ean Vineyard has been acquired. Plantings include semillon (14ha), shiraz (11.5ha), chardonnay (6.5ha) and smaller areas of merlot, muscat and viognier. In 2008 a new winery, adjoining the cellar door, was completed; all Tinklers wines are now vinified here (distinguished by a gold strip at the bottom of the label). The majority of the grape production continues to be sold to McWilliams.
