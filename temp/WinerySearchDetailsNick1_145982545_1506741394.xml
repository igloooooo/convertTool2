            Syd and Julie Pond have established their vineyard with shiraz the most important variety, the remainder planted to chenin blanc, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, verdelho, viognier and merlot. Children Michael and Lisa are also involved in the business. Most of the wines have a degree of sweetness, which will doubtless appeal to cellar door and restaurant customers. Exports to Canada and Hong Kong.
