            One of the historical treasures of Australia; the oft-photographed stone wine cellars are the oldest in the Clare Valley, and winemaking is still carried out under the direction of the Jesuitical Manresa Society. Value for money is excellent, particularly for the powerful Shiraz and Riesling; all the wines reflect the estate-grown grapes from old vines. Notwithstanding the difficult economic times, Sevenhill Cellars has increased its vineyard holdings from 74 to 104 ha, and production has risen by 4000 dozen. Exports to the US, Switzerland, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Vietnam and China.
