            Many years ago, Jim Elson worked as a winemaker for Seppelt at Rutherglen, Barossa Valley and Great Western, before moving to WA with wife Carol and family. They named Carosa for their three daughters (Catherine, Rosemary and Sarah), and the latest range of wines is named after their six grandchildren.
