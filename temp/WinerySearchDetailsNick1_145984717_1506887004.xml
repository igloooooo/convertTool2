            The name Karra Yerta is derived from the local Aboriginal language, karra the name for the majestic red gum trees, and yerta meaning country or ground. The landscape has changed little (other than the patches of vineyard) since the ancestors of James and Marie Linke arrived (separately) in SA in 1847. Both James and Marie were born in Angaston, but moved to Flaxmans Valley in 1985, and in 87 purchased one of the old stone cottages in the region. Much time has been spent in reviving the largely abandoned vineyard, which provides most of their grapes; plantings now include semillon, riesling, shiraz and frontignac. While most of the grapes were sold, they indulged in home winemaking for many years, but have now moved into commercial winemaking on a micro scale.
