            This was a joint venture between land (and vineyard) owners Greg and Kerilee Brindle, and winemaker Larry Cherubino and wife Edwina. Now fully-owned by the latter, the vineyard (cabernet sauvignon, merlot, sauvignon blanc and semillon) was planted in 1998, the grapes being sold over the ensuing years to other winemakers in the region. Distribution by Bibendum on the eastern seaboard is testimony to the skills of Larry Cherubino, leading to increased sales. This is a venture worth watching.
