            Somervaille Estate was a foundation member of the Central Highlands Grapegrowers Association (now ORVA), centred on Orange; the vineyard is on the Belubula River, near Carcoar. David Somervaille was the chairman of partners of the national law firm Blake Dawson Waldron. Like myself, he is a self-taught winemaker, his early experience with wine coming through his participation in a partnership which operated the Oakdale Vineyard (now Audrey Wilkinson) in the Hunter Valley (which was sold in 1980). Wines are available in small quantities by mail order and cellar door.
