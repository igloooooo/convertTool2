            Raleigh Winery lays claim to being Australias most easterly vineyard, situated south of Coffs Harbour on the banks of the Bellinger River. The wines are produced in part from the small estate vineyard planted to chambourcin (one-third) and villard blanc (two-thirds). Raleigh has been owned by Lavinia Dingle since 1989.
