            Alec Harper and partner Peta Elliott purchased their 14ha property in 1997, and the following year established a pinot noir vineyard. This may seem a small planting, but they obtained cuttings from Alecs sister Brenda and brother-in-law Peter Bosworth at Morningside Vineyard. Their garage was turned into a nursery, with lights on 24 hours a day, encouraging the cuttings to strike and thus become rootlings ready to plant. Since then the duo has micro-managed every task in the vineyard: when a caterpillar invasion occurred they spent every evening with buckets in hand, picking off the caterpillars one at a time. Alec has a full-time job, so Peta is responsible for the B&amp;B they opened on their property in 2003, and, as if this werent enough, in 09 they purchased an 1846 heritage-listed cottage in Richmond (only 10km from their house in Cambridge), opened in late 09 also under Petas care.
