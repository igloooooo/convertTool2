            Peter and Margaret Hyland planted a little under 2ha of vineyard in 1993, on the Freycinet coast. The first wines were made from the 1999 vintage, forcing retired builder Peter to complete their home so that the small building in which they had been living could be converted into a cellar door. The vineyard looks out towards the settlement of Darlington on Maria Island, the site of Diego Bernacchis attempt to establish a vineyard in the 1880s and lure investors by attaching artificial bunches of grapes to his vines. Darlington Vineyard is now owned by Paul and Louise Stranan.
