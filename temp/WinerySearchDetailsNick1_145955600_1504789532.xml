            Cape Lodge has evolved from a protea farm in the early 1980s, through a small luxury B&amp;B operation in 93 into a boutique hotel via a multi-million dollar investment. This has resulted in a plethora of awards since 2005, most recently being voted one of the Worlds Best of Best Hotels 11, Best Boutique Hotel in Australia, and among the Worlds Top 20 Vineyard Hotels 10 and Cond Nast Traveller Gold List Best for Food 11.
