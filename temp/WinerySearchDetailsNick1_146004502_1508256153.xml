            Klaus and Denise Griese have established a Josephâ€™s coat of varieties since 1995; in descending order shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, colombard, semillon, pinot noir, pinot gris, merlot, riesling and verdelho totalling a little under 5 ha in all. The vineyard is planted on a northeast slope near the top of the ridge overlooking the Bass River Valley, and a 3-storey winery (the bottom floor underground) has been built. All of the wines are, to a lesser or greater degree, sweet, and aimed at the cellar door.
