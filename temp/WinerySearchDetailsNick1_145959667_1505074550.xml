            The Clancy family has been carrying on a mixed farming enterprise (lucerne growing, cropping and sheep production) on their property north of Deniliquin for over 25 years. A tiny planting of taminga was made in 1988, but it was not until 6ha were planted in 97 that the Clancys ventured into commercial grapegrowing and winemaking. The predominant varieties are shiraz and semillon, and the production is sold through the cellar door.
