            Wildcroft Estate is the brainchild of Devendra Singh, best known as the owner of one of Vics oldest Indian restaurants. In 1988 he purchased the land upon which 4ha of pinot noir, chardonnay, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon have been established, with the management and much of the physical work carried out by Devendras wife Shashi Singh, who undertook a viticulture course. The vineyard is one of the few unirrigated vineyards on the Peninsula. The mudbrick cellar door also has a restaurant  Caf 98  allowing Devendra to explore the matching of Indian food with wine. The caf serves modern cuisine with Indian and Middle Eastern influences, using local produce wherever possible.
