            In 1999, after their children had left the nest, Phil and Judy Meehan decided to return to the country and grow grapes for sale to wineries. In that year they took the first step, planting a small pinot noir vineyard at Bannockburn. It then took until April 2003 to find a near-perfect site, just within the Heathcote town boundary, its northeast-facing gentle slope on the famous Cambrian soil. Phil graduated with a Diploma of Winemaking and a Diploma of Viticulture in 05, saying, After a mere six years of study I only learned, after all that time, just how much more to winemaking there was to learn. The planting stock was secured from nearby vineyards with similar soil, and planting is continuing. Exports to the UK.
