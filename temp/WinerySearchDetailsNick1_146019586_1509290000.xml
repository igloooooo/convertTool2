            Dr Barry Wilson is a biologist and specialist on Australian marine shells and marine ecology, and a director of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. He and his family planted the first 4 ha of semillon and shiraz in 1993, subsequently extending the plantings to 6 ha. Part of the proceeds of the sale of the wines is donated to various wildlife conservation activities, particularly the restoration of endangered species.
