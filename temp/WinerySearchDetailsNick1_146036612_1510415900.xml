            The Witham family (Scott and Sue, Jim and Ann) began the development of Wadjekanup River Estate in 1995 as a minor diversification for a 3000ha wool, prime lamb, beef and cereal cropping enterprise worked by the family. They began with 1.2ha of shiraz and sauvignon blanc, since extended to 8ha, including a 1ha block of merlot. The aims for the future include a purpose-built cellar for storage and sales, with a possibility of farm-stay accommodation. The present wine range of Sauvignon Blanc and Shiraz will be extended with a varietal Merlot, and perhaps a Semillon.
