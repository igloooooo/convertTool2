            This is the new venture of former Tarrington winemaker Tamara Irish, who has joined forces with NZ-born Julia Hailes (a Francophile, violinist and psychodramatist) to buy a small property near Dunkeld, at the base of the Grampians mountain range. Tamara and Julia are fiercely committed to biodynamic grapegrowing, and are moving towards the establishment of a little over 1ha of densely planted, low-yielding and multi-clonal shiraz, and a small winery, hopefully, to process shiraz to be purchased from the same source as that used for the former Artemesia label of Tarrington vineyards. The last of the Tarrington wines made by Tamara are being marketed under the Enigma Variations brand (the site and source acknowledged on the labels) and are being sold through Enigma, including 2006 and 07 Pinot Noir, and 07 Shiraz.
