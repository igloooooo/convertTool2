            Summit Estate is the public face of the Stanthorpe Wine Co., owned by a syndicate of 10 professionals who work in Brisbane, and share a love of wine. They operate the Stanthorpe Wine Centre, which offers wine education as well as selling wines from other makers in the region (and, of course, from Summit Estate). The vineyard is planted to chardonnay, marsanne, viognier, verdelho, muscat of Alexandria, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot, tempranillo, monastrell, garnacha, malbec, petit verdot and cabernet sauvignon, and they have set up a small, specialised contract winemaking facility. The wines have improved out of all recognition under the direction of Argentine-born and Spanish-trained Paola Cabezas Rhymer. Exports to the UK.
