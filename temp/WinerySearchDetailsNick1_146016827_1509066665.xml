            Jeff and Margaret Lester have established their vineyard on a north-facing slope overlooking Rose Valley and Werri Beach. Planting began in 1998, and now extends to chardonnay, verdelho, sauvignon blanc, chambourcin, ruby cabernet and nebbiolo. Cellar door sales are not available as there is no public access from the Princes Highway.
