            Daryl and Vicki Higgins opened Hunting Lodge Estate on their 140ha cattle property in 1999, originally with a cellar door and B&amp;B. A winery opened in 2002, and there is now a kaleidoscopic array of table and fortified wines available, mostly with African game park associations. For good measure, there is a personal museum of hunting trophies.
