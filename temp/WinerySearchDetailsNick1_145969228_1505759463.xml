            Farrawell had a dream start to its commercial life when its 2001 Chardonnay was awarded the trophy for Best Chardonnay at the Macedon Ranges Wine Exhibition 03. Given that just under 1ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir, and a small amount of sauvignon blanc, are the sole source of wines, production will always be limited. Trefor Morgan is the owner/winemaker of Mount Charlie Winery, but was perhaps better known as a Professor of Physiology at Melbourne University.
