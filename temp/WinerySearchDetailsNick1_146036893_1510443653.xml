            Wandoo Farm lies outside any of the existing wine regions, due east of the Blackwood Valley (its nearest regional neighbour). Donald Cochrane owns a 650ha sheep, cattle and grain farm near Duranillin, with a 23-inch annual rainfall and abundant underground water. His maternal grandfather came to Australia from Kaiser Stuhl in Germany, later settling near Kojonup, where he planted a vineyard and made the community wine. Donald Cochrane has one of his original vines (malbec) growing in the present day Wandoo Farm vineyard. Here there are 7ha of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, zinfandel, verdelho, viognier and marsanne.
