            Philip Shaw, former chief winemaker of Rosemount Estate and then Southcorp, first became interested in the Orange region in 1985. In 88 he purchased the Koomooloo Vineyard and began extensive plantings, the varieties including shiraz, merlot, pinot noir, sauvignon blanc, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and viognier. Son Daniel has joined Philip in the winery, at a time when the quality of the portfolio of wines goes from strength to strength. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
