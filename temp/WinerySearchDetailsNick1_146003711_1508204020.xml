            David Wise began establishing his 6.8ha vineyard (2ha each of pinot noir, riesling and cabernet sauvignon, and 0.8ha of chardonnay) in 1984. The vines are planted on deep red basalt soils, and have been dry-grown since the word go. Rejuvenation of the trellis, and the battle against disease has succeeded, and it is intended to increase plantings over the next few years.
