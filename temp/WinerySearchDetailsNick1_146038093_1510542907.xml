            The Snep family (Ronald, Jackson and Alexandra) began developing Welshmans Reef Vineyard in 1986, planting cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and semillon. Chardonnay and merlot were added in the early 1990s, with sauvignon blanc and tempranillo later. The 6ha vineyard is certified organic. For some years the grapes were sold to other wineries, but in the early 1990s the Sneps decided to share winemaking facilities established in the Old Newstead Co-operative Butter Factory with several other small vineyards. When the Butter Factory facility closed down, the Sneps built a winery and mudbrick tasting room onsite, 6km north of Newstead.
