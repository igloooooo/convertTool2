            Bob Fowler, who comes from a rural background and has always hankered after a farming life, stumbled across the opportunity to achieve this in early 2010. Together with wife Marilyn, he purchased the former West Cape Howe winery and surrounding vineyard that had become available when West Cape Howe moved into the far larger Goundrey winery. In 11 Willoughby Park purchased the Kalgan River vineyard and business name, and winemaking operations have been transferred to Willoughby Park. There are now three labels: Willoughby Park, the Great Southern premium brand for estate and purchased grapes; Kalgan River, a single vineyard range; and Jamie &amp; Charli, a sub-$20 Great Southern range of wines.
