            Long-term sommeliers and friends Adam Foster and Lincoln Riley have established a business that has a very clear vision: food-friendly wine based on the versatility of sangiovese. They make their wine at Syrahmi, building it from the ground up, with fermentation in both stainless steel and a mixture of older French oak barrels.
