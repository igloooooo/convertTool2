            Len and Barbara Davies progressively established their vineyard (cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, chenin blanc, chardonnay, semillon, sauvignon blanc and merlot), initially selling the grapes. In 2006 the decision was taken to move to winemaking. It has been rewarded with considerable show success for its consistently good, enticingly priced wines. Exports to the UK, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore and China.
