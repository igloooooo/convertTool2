            Bent Road is owned by winemaker Glen Robert and vineyard manager Robert Richter. Glen is a former medical research chemist, but moved into winemaking simply because he (and Robert) fell under the spell of wine around 2000. Glen put together vintage experience at Cakebread Cellars in the Napa Valley (04), Clovely Estate (0406) and Heritage Estate (05). He has also found time to work for Sirromet, Symphony Hill and Granite Ridge wineries. Robert moved from photography, engineering, catering and property development to focus on the organic management of the vineyard, which is planted to tempranillo, shiraz, merlot, marsanne, semillon and verdelho. Chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon are purchased from local growers. Exports to Hong Kong.
