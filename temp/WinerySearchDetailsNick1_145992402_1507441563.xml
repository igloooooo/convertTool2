            This business has very interesting parentage. Dianne and David Cliffe started the business as seedling growers in Narromine before establishing a vine propagation nursery via a sister company (which they also own). Here they have 33 varieties collected from various parts of Australia, mainly from very old vines, but also including carmenere (sourced from Chile some years ago), barbera, tempranillo, viognier, sangiovese, shiraz and chardonnay. As the collection has aged, so has it grown, moving into grapegrowing and winemaking as a further arm of the business. Ken Borchardt of Red Earth Estate is the contract maker for this and many other businesses in the region.
