            The Morrison family established a Hermes Poll Dorset Stud in 1972, which has now been joined by Hermes Morrison Wines. The cellar door has been built by the side of a large lake fed by cold, clear water welling up from subterranean caves. A 10-minute walk takes you to the summit of Mt Palatine, one of the highest peaks in the shire, with a spectacular view of the Canobolas Mountains 80km away.
