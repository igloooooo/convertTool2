            Bill and Sandra Blamires acquired their property after a two-year search of the southern Bendigo area for what they considered an ideal location. They have firmly planted their faith in shiraz (5.9ha), with merlot, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and viognier contributing 1.5ha. The winery was previously called Blamires Butterfly Crossing (because of the butterfly population on Axe Creek, which runs through the property), but has been changed due to confusion with Angoves Butterfly Ridge.
