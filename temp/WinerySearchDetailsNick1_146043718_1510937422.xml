            Bronwyn and Keith Thomas planted pinot noir (two-thirds) and chardonnay over 1998 and 99. They say the early vintages were consumed by family and friends, and as the vines have gained maturity and moved to full-cropping, part of the production has been sold to other wineries in the region. The business is part of a function venue, which has expansive views of Colac, with the vineyard in the foreground.
