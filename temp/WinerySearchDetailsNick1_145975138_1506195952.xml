            Partners David Smith, Robert Bennet and Kerry Jones have established their vineyard at Coatsworth Farm, with sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz, cabernet franc, malbec and merlot. The vineyard, with its sandy loam soil and a northerly aspect, is influenced by the maritime climate of the Port Phillip and Corio Bays.
