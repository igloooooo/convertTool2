            Broken Gate is a Melbourne-based multi-regional producer, specialising in cool climate reds and whites. Founder Josef Orbach lived and worked in the Clare Valley from 1994 to 98 at Leasingham Wines, and is currently studying wine technology and viticulture at the University of Melbourne. His is a classic negociant business, buying grapes and/or wines from various regions; the wines may be either purchased in bulk, then blended and bottled by Orbach, or purchased as cleanskins. The wine glut has been a great boon for his business. Last years rating has been retained. Exports to Canada, Thailand, Singapore and China.
