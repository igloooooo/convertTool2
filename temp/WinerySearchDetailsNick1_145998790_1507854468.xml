            The Dennis family has farmed at Mopeta (an Aboriginal word meaning running water) since the 1920s. In 1997, Robert, Michelle, Peter and Bev Dennis began plantings of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, followed by further shiraz in 98 and 2001. Most of the grapes are sold, but a small amount is retained for the Bridal Track label. The name is a play on words; the real bridle track (a 4WD track over the Flinders Ranges) has a story from the early 1900s of a bridegroom taking his new wife to their new home over the ranges via horseback on their wedding night.
