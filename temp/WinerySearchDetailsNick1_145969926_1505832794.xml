            Bob and Sue Peime purchased the most historically significant viticultural holding on the Mornington Peninsula in 1998. Development of the 68ha property began in the early 1930s, and was sold to a member of the Seppelt family, who planted riesling in 48. Two years later the property was sold to the Broadhurst family, close relatives of Doug Seabrook, who persisted with growing and making riesling until a 1967 bushfire destroyed the vines. Since 1998 (in descending order) pinot noir, chardonnay, shiraz, pinot gris and cabernet sauvignon have been planted.
