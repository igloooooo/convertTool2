            Terry and Merylyn Winters have invested substantially in their 33ha property on the Coolart Hills, with views over Westernport Bay to French Island, Tortoise Head, Phillip Island, Gippsland and Mt Baw Baw. As well vines (predominantly five clones of pinot noir on a variety of spacings and trellises) they have established extensive botanical gardens incorporating three lakes, a bushland area and adjoining wetlands. The lagoons serve a practical purpose as well as an aesthetic one, providing irrigation from over 30 megalitres of storage. An onsite winery has been built, and Jeremy Magyar appointed full-time winemaker.
