            Melbourne orthopaedic surgeon David Booth planted a total of 4ha of pinot noir, pinot gris and shiraz on a large property situated on warm, northern slopes overlooking Dromana and the busy South Channel leading to the port of Melbourne. At times, says David Booth, the big ships seem to appear in the vineyard. Other varieties are being trialled in a nursery section, and the range of wines may increase somewhere down the track.
