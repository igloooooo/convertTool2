            This is the venture of the Maiolo family, headed by winemaker Charlie. The macabre name is that of one of the most famous surf breaks on the Margaret River coast. The vineyard is planted to semillon, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. The site climate is strongly influenced by Geographe Bay, 5km to the north, and facilitates the production of wines with a large spectrum of flavours and characteristics.
