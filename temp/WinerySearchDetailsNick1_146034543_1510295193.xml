            Peter and Jane Hamshere are the new owners of Undercliff, and it continues to function as both winery cellar door and art gallery. The wines, produced from estate plantings of shiraz, semillon, chambourcin and muscat, have won a number of awards in recent years at the Hunter Valley Wine Show and the Hunter Valley Small Winemakers Show. Exports to Japan.
