            Scorpiiion Wines is the concept of Mark Herbertt, who decided to buy a small quantity of McLaren Vale and Barossa grapes in 2002 and have the wine made for himself, friends and family. In 04 Paddy Phillips and Michael Szwarcbord  with Mark Herbertt, they share the Scorpio birth sign  joined the partnership. It is a virtual winery, with the grapes purchased, and the wines contract-made by the brilliant Peter Schell. They say,We share a number of likes and dislikes in relation to Australian red wines  apart from that, we dont really agree on anything... We aim for a fruit-driven style with elegant oak, rather than a big, oak-driven style. Oh, and they are united in their insistence on using screwcaps rather than corks.
