            The grapegrowing and winemaking practices of Burgundy permeate every aspect of Tarrington Vineyards. While its establishment began in 1993, there has been no hurry to bring the vineyard into production. Two varieties only have been planted: pinot noir and chardonnay, with a planting density varying between 3333 and 8170 vines per ha. There are no less than nine clones in the 2 ha of pinot noir, and four clones in the 0.5 ha of chardonnay. The approach to making the Pinot Noir is common in Burgundy, while the unoaked Chardonnay is kept in tank on fine lees for nine months, the traditional method of making Chablis. Everything about the operation speaks of a labour of love, with a high standard of packaging and presentation of all background material. The exemplary wines are to be found on a thoroughly impressive collection of Vic's top restaurant wine lists. Miniscule exports to the UK.
