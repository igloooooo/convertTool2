            Three generations of the Tucker family were involved in the first plantings at Peacetree Estate in 1995; however, it was of olive trees, not vines. One ha each of sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon followed, 0.8ha viognier coming later. For the first three vintages the grapes were sold, and in 2001 the Tuckers decided to take the plunge and have the wine bottled under the Peacetree Estate label.
