            This is the ultimate virtual winery, a joint venture between famed Mosel-Saar-Ruwer winemaker (and proprietor) Egon Muller, Michael Andrewartha from Adelaides East End Cellars, and the extraordinarily well-qualified Akos Forczek, with multiple tertiary degrees and fluent in Hungarian, French, English, Russian and Arabic. A three-year search for the perfect riesling site ended almost where the journey began, at the Shaw &amp; Smith Adelaide Hills vineyard. Muller arrived on the day of picking to oversee the whole production of the first vintage, carried out at Shaw &amp; Smith with input from Shaw &amp; Smiths winemaker, Darryl Catlin. The grapes were crushed and cold-soaked for up to 16 hours, the juice settled without enzyme and kept at 12C until spontaneous fermentation began. Small wonder that the wine is so different from other Australian rieslings, and even more different from the gloriously fine wines that Muller makes at home. Exports to the UK, the U, Canada, Germany and Japan.
