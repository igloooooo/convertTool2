            Sally and Roger Cook have a 140ha property in the Adelaide Hills that takes its name from Cobb &amp; Co, which used it as a staging post and resting place for 1000 horses. The Cooks now use the property to raise Angus cattle, grow cherries and, more recently, grapes. Three different sites on the property, amounting to just over 10 ha, were planted to selected clones of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, semillon, riesling and merlot. Part of the production is sold to Shaw &amp; Smith, who vinify the remainder for Cobbs Hill. The Sauvignon Blanc has been most successful.
