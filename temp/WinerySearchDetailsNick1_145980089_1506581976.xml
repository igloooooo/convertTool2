            Hotham Ridge Winery started life as Hotham Valley Estate, and after several changes of ownership, during which time the vineyards suffered a degree of neglect, the property was purchased by Leonard Bruin and Wouter Denig in 2002. By this time the winery had been stripped of all equipment, and had to be re-equipped for the 2003 vintage. The patchwork quilt vineyard is planted to chardonnay, chenin blanc, riesling, semillon, vermentino, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, tempranillo and zinfandel. Grafting of some of the riesling and verdelho is also underway. Exports to the Caribbean, Singapore and China.
