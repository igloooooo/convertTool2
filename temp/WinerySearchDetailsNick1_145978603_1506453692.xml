            Heritage Estate (owned by Bryce and Paddy Kassulke) has two estate vineyards in the Granite Belt, one at Cottonvale (north) at an altitude of 960m, where it grows white varieties, and the other at Ballandean, a slightly warmer site where red varieties and marsanne are planted. Heritage Estate has been a prolific award-winner in various Qld wine shows and (I am pleased to report) it has invested in a new bottling line enabling it to use screwcaps.
