            Six generations of the Flint family have lived and worked in Coonawarra since 1840. Damian Flint and his family began the development of 84ha of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot in 1989, but it was not until 2000 that they decided to have a small portion of cabernet sauvignon contract-made. Damian and Sue oversee the day-to-day running of both the vineyard and the farm, with Matthew, who studied viticulture in the Barossa, managing the vineyard. Exports to the UK and Hong Kong.
