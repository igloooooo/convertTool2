            Mark and Lainie Staniford purchased a 110-year-old stone house surrounded by extensive gardens on the outskirts of Bridgetown in 1999. It gave Mark Staniford the opportunity of realising a lifelong dream of making wine after he opened WAs first specialist wine shop in North Fremantle in 1965. He has established 0.25ha each of semillon, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, the original intention being to make the equivalents of white and red Bordeaux respectively. Both red and white wines are pressed in hand-operated basket presses, the whites barrel-fermented, the reds mainly open-fermented.
