            Glenn and Chris Richardsons Observatory Hill Vineyard began in 1991, when Glenn and his late father-in-law Jim Ramsey planted the first of the 8500 vines that now make up the estate. Together with the adjoining property, owned by Chris brother Wayne and his wife Stephanie, the vineyard now covers just over 3ha, new plantings having been made each year. The name Observatory Hill comes from the states oldest observatory, which is perched on the hill above the vineyard.
