            Scott and Julie Wright began establishing their vineyard (1ha each of pinot gris, pinot noir and shiraz, an 0.5ha of riesling) in 1999, and now operate a winery making both their own wines and wines for three other producers. They also purchase grapes from other growers; an estate-grown Organic Syrah is the flagship wine.
