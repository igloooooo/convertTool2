            This is very much a weekend hobby for medical practitioner Gordon McIntosh, who invests his chardonnay and pinot noir with Burgundian complexity. The combined effect of heatwaves, drought, bushfires and smoke taint meant no vintage in either 2007 or '09, and only a few dozen of Sauvignon Blanc from purchased grapes in '08. A small quantity of Pinot Noir was made in '10.
