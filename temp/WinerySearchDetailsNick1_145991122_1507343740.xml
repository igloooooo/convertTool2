            Lloyd Brothers Wine and Olive Company is owned and operated by David and Matthew Lloyd, third-generation McLaren Vale vignerons. Their 25ha estate overlooks the township, and is planted to shiraz and old olive trees. The single variety plantings allows the creation of a full range of styles, including Rose, Sparkling Shiraz, Fortified Shiraz and Estate Shiraz, along with the White Chalk Shiraz, so named because of the white chalk used to mark each barrel during the classification process.
