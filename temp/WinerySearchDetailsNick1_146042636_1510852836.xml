            This is the venture of the Lucindale Area School, which has a vine-to-wine program. The school has 1.5ha each of pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon, and the winery has been established in an old farmhouse adjacent to the vineyard. The students are involved in all aspects of viticulture and winemaking, including onsite chemical analysis, label design and bottling. Lucindale won the National Schools Wine Show '05 with a 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon, and is involved in various regional activities. The name, incidentally, is derived from the Yackadale Murray Grey cattle stud. The wines are sold through the school and selected local outlets.
