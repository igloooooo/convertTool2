            Rick Hill is running a unique wine business, the name Labyrinth being well chosen. While it is a Pinot Noir-only specialist, one is produced in the southern hemisphere (from the Yarra Valley) and one from the northern hemisphere (Santa Barbara, California) each year. The wines come from individual vineyards: the Bien Nacido Vineyard has a deserved reputation as one of the best sources of pinot noir in California. Rick Hill uses leased space in California and at Long Gully Estate to make the wines, and also has active consultancy work in California. Exports to the US, Canada and Bahamas.
