            Patrick, a graduate of CSU, and Amanda Oâ€™Sullivan (and two business partners) have established a trial planting of four clones of merlot, and have found the difference between each of the clones to be substantial. The Wild Geese name, incidentally, comes from the Irish emigres who fled religious and political persecution in the 18th century to settle elsewhere.
