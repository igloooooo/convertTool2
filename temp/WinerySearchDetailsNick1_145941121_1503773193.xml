            This is the family business of Mike and Mary Dilworth, the name coming from a winter creek that runs alongside the vineyard and a view of The Abbey in the Stirling Range. The vineyard is equally split between riesling, pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon planted in 1990 and 93. The Rieslings have had significant show success for a number of years, occasionally joined by the Pinot Noir at the top of the tree.
