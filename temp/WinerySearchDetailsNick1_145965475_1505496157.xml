            Domaines Tatiarra Ltd. is an unlisted public company, its core asset being a 60ha property of Cambrian earth identified and developed by Bill Hepburn, who sold to the company in 1991. It produces only one varietal wine: Shiraz. The majority of the wine comes from the Tatiarra (an Aboriginal word meaning beautiful country) property, but the Trademark Shiraz is an equal blend of McLaren Vale and Heathcote wine. The wines are made at the Pettavel Winery in Geelong, with Ben Riggs commuting between there and McLaren Vale as required. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Singapore and China.
