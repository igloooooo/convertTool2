            Montgomerys Hill is 16km northeast of Albany on a north-facing slope on the banks of the Kalgan River. Previously used as an apple orchard, it is a diversification for the third generation of the Montgomery family. Chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, sauvignon blanc, shiraz and merlot were planted in 199697. The wines are made with a gentle touch.
