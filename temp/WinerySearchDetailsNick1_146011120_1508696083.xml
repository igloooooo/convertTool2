            Anthony and Catherine Hancy acquired the Lavender Bay Vineyard in early 2002, renaming it Prancing Horse Estate and embarking on increasing the estate vineyards, with 2ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir, and 0.5ha of pinot gris. The vineyard moved to organic farming in 03, progressing to biodynamic in 07. They appointed Sergio Carlei as winemaker, and the following year became joint owners with Sergio in Carlei Wines. An additional property 150m west of the existing vineyard has been purchased, and 2ha of vines was planted there in the spring of 10. Prancing Horse has become one of a small group of Australian wineries having wines specifically made for them in Burgundy. Pascal Marchand makes an annual release of Morey-St-Denis Clos des Ormes Premier Cru and Meursault Premier Cru Blagny,while Patrick Piuze makes four Chablis appellation wines. Exports to the UK, the US, France and Sweden.
