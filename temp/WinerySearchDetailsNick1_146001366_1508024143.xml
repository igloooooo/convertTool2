            Mt Jaggeds vineyard was established in 1989 by the White family, with close-planted semillon, chardonnay, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz. The vineyard sits at 350m above sea level on a diversity of soils ranging from ironstone/clay for the red varieties to sandy loam/clay for the whites. The cool climate vineyard (altitude and proximity to the ocean) produces fresh, crisp, zingy white wines and medium-bodied savoury reds of complexity and depth. The vineyard has good rainfall and natural spring water in abundance, and is currently in the process of conversion to organic/biodynamic viticulture principles. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada and China.
