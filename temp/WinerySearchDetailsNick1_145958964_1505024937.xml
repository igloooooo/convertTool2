            John and Beatrice (Bea) Feaks established the Chislehurst vineyard in 1989. The 4ha of plantings are on the historic Putty Road, 50km to the west of Cessnock, but isolated by the Yengo National Park and the Brokenback Range. Its elevation is 100m higher than the Hunter proper, which also differentiates the wine styles from those of the Hunter.
