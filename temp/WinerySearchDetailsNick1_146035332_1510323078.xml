            Pasquale (Pat) and Vittoria (Vicky) Vasarelli moved with their parents from Melbourne to McLaren Vale in 1976. They began the establishment of their vineyard, and over the succeeding years increased the area under vine to its present size, planted to semillon, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot gris, vermentino, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Until 95 the grapes were sold to other producers, but in that year they joined Cellarmaster Wines and the Vasarelli label was born. In a reverse play to the usual pattern, they opened a cellar door in 2009 on a small property they had purchased in 92.
