            Sergio Carlei has come a long way in a short time: graduating from home winemaking in a suburban garage to his own (commercial) winery in Upper Beaconsfield; Carlei Estate falls just within the boundaries of the Yarra Valley. Along the way Carlei acquired a Bachelor of Wine Science from CSU, and established a vineyard with organic and biodynamic accreditation adjacent to the Upper Beaconsfield winery. His contract winemaking services are now a major part of the business, and showcase his extremely impressive winemaking talents. Exports to the US, Canada, Sweden, China, Singapore and Malaysia.
