            Shawn Kalleske (who has his fingers in a number of Barossa pies) has joined forces with Joel Mattschoss to begin the development of Moppa Wilton Vineyards. Joel has 30ha of vineyards and Shawn 12 ha, the lions share in each case shiraz, but also with significant quantities of grenache. Only a small amount of the grapes from the two vineyards are retained for the Moppa Wilton label, by far the largest portion being sold to other Barossa wineries. The name Maczos for the Shiraz goes back five generations to the Maczos family being forced to leave Hungary and settle in Germany in the early 1600s, changing their name to the more German-friendly Mattschoss.
