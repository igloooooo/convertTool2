            Val Diamond and Professor John Funder (of Prince Henrys Institute at the Monash Medical Centre) purchased the vineyard in 2003, when the chardonnay vines were already 13 years old. They also planted cabernet sauvignon, which has now come into bearing. Thus, both the 2005 and 2006 Restif Chardonnay came off the Front Block (as it is known). Exports to the US and Hong Kong.
