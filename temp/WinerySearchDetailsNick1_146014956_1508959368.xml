            Don Riseborough and Susan Lamp began developing their 8.7ha vineyard, a stones throw from Moondah Brook, in 1998. They have planted shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and grenache; the grapes take the slightly unusual trip south to Margaret River where the red wines are made by Flying Fish Cove. A small selection of non-estate white wines (Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Verdelho, all with a small amount of residual sweetness) are made by Rob Marshall in the Swan Valley.
