            Drew and wife Raegan Noon returned to McLaren Vale and purchased Noons from Drew's parents in 1996. Drew had previously spent many years as a consultant oenologist and viticulturist in Vic, and thereafter for a time as winemaker at Cassegrain. He has always revelled in the richness of very ripe grapes, and the wines (which can exceed 17% alc/vol) are eagerly snapped up by customers on the annual mailing list. Exports to the UK, the US, and other major markets.
