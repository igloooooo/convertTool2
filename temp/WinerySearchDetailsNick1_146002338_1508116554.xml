            Nangwarry Station was purchased by Ian McLachlan in 1964, variously a former high profile President of the National Farmers Federation and Federal Minister of Defence. The property is now managed by Ians son Dugald and wife Sophie, ardent supporters of the familys philosophy of long-term sustainability. One example is the wetlands and conservation areas which have created natural habitats for over 100 species of birds. In what is a large business, the establishment of 9ha of vineyard (4ha of cabernet sauvignon, 3ha of pinot noir and 1ha each of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc) is a small diversification, but it has been a very successful one. The immensely experienced (and equally likeable) Peter Douglas, for many years a winemaker in Coonawarra, has produced some lovely wines.
