            One might have thought the partners of Gipsie Jack have enough wine on their plate already, but some just cant resist the temptation, it seems. The two in question are John Glaetzer and Ben Potts, who made a little over 500 dozen from two growers in their inaugural vintage in 2004 (that quantity has increased substantially since). Glaetzer and Potts say, We want to make this label fun, like in the old days. No pretentiousness, no arrogance, not even a back label. A great wine at a great price, with no discounting. Exports to Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.
