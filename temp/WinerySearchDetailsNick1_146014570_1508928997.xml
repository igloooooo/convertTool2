            The Rickety Gate vineyard is situated on north-facing slopes of the Bennet Ranges, in an area specifically identified by Dr John Gladstones as highly suited to cool climate viticulture. The property was purchased by Russell and Linda Hubbard at the end of 1999, and 2ha of merlot, 1ha of riesling, 0.3ha of pinot noir and 0.1ha of chardonnay have been planted. John Wade contract-makes the wines at the small onsite winery.
