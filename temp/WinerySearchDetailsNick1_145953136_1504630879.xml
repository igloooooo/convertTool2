            Brothers Parade is a highly unusual partnership. With a friendship going back to primary school, it brings together Sydney Swans defender Jared Crouch (living in Sydney) with best friend Trent Fraser (now based in New York). The name comes from Norwoods main street, The Parade, the epicentre of their childhood world. This is thus the ultimate virtual winery, friends and family living in the Adelaide Hills involved in both sourcing the grapes and winemaking.
