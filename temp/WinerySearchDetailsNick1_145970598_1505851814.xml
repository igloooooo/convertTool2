            Les Hanel decided to diversify the production of what was a fine wool and beef cattle farm in 1993. Instead of simply jumping in at the deep end, as so many have done, he first enrolled at CSU to study viticulture and winemaking as a mature-age student. He began the plantings the following year on a southeast-facing hill slope at an altitude above 600m. The degraded granite over red clay soil was acidic, and was deep-ripped to allow penetration of lime. Over the ensuing years riesling, chardonnay and merlot have been established at a deliberately slow pace; Les explains, Our cellar door is a work-in-progress and we should have the cladding on soon!
