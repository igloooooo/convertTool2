            A boutique, family-owned biodynamic vineyard, Krinklewood produces 100% estate-grown wines reflecting the terroir of the Broke Fordwich subregion of the Hunter Valley. The cellar door is set among Provenal-style gardens that overlook the vineyard, with the Wollombi Brook and Brokenback range providing a spectacular backdrop. In 2010 the winery was extended and upgraded, including the installation of a Vaslin Bucher basket press.
