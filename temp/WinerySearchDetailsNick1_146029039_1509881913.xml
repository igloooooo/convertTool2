            Ten Miles East takes its name from the fact that it is that distance and direction from the Adelaide GPO. It is the venture of industry veteran John Greenshields, and Robin and Judith Smallacombe and is, to put it mildly, an interesting one. Its home vineyard in the Adelaide Hills is planted principally to riesling and sauvignon blanc, with smaller plantings of pinot noir, shiraz, carmenere and saperavi, a Josephs coat if ever there was one. Next, there is a joint-venture vineyard on the Yorke Peninsula planted to shiraz (3000 vines) and carmenere (1000 vines). Finally, Ten Miles East purchases 24 tonnes of shiraz per year from Wrattonbully (where, many years ago, John founded Koppamurra, now Tapanappa). The winery and cellar door in what was the Auldwood Cider Factory, built in 1962.
