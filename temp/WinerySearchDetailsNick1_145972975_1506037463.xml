            Glandore Estate is the reincarnation of the Brokenback Vineyard established as part of The Rothbury Estate in the early 1970s, but it had an even longer history. It was purchased by legendary grapegrowers Mick and Jack Phillips in the 30s, and given the Glandore name. New owners David Madson, John Cambridge and Peter McBeath, who acquired the property in 2004 (with existing chardonnay vines), have extended the plantings with savagnin, semillon and viognier.
