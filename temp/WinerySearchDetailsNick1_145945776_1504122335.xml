            Barambah is owned by Jane and Steve Wilson, who live there in a historic 19th century home. During the time they owned the large cattle property Barambah Station, they found themselves next-door neighbours to Barambah Wines. They purchased the winery and vineyard, retaining them after they sold their cattle station. The 2011 vintage was devastated in the South Burnett region, with total annual rainfall occurring in three months leading up to and including vintage. A gallant decision to double-prune the cabernet sauvignon was hit by hail, eliminating that venture. Other left-field winemaking techniques have been inspired and managed by Peter Scudamore-Smith MW, and the outlook for 2012 was much better.
