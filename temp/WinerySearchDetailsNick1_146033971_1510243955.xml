            Dr David Leslie gave up his job as a medical practitioner after completing the Bachelor of Applied Science (Wine Science) at Charles Sturt University, to concentrate on developing the family's 10-ha estate at Dromana; wife Paula is the viticulturist. They have also established what is described as the first purpose-built cooking school in an Australian vineyard. Exports to the UK, the US and Hong Kong. The Leslies are reluctantly seeking to sell Turramurra Estate as the physical demands of viticulture and winemaking have become too great.
