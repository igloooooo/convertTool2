            Di and Rob Goodwin (plus children Hannah and Callum) purchased the Heron Lake Vineyard from its founders, Mike and Faith Sparrow, in 2001, at which time the vineyard was 20 years old. There is a little over 6 ha of vines, chardonnay accounting for 2.6 ha, the remainder verdelho, semillon, sauvignon blanc, cabernet and merlot. Both Rob and Di are involved in postgraduate viticulture studies at various WA campuses. Exports to the UK, Canada and Singapore.
