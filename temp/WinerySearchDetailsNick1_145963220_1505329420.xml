            This is a weekend and weekday night busmans holiday for Rob Wills and Frank Dawson. Rob is a professional viticulturist with a day job of running a vineyard in the Goulburn Valley, while Frank Dawson is an engineer manufacturing equipment for the farming, mining and construction industries. As neighbours, they first formed a partnership agisting sheep and cattle, and this in turn led to the establishment of their vineyard, which has 3.6ha of sauvignon blanc, 2.5ha of pinot noir, 1ha each of cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo, and a few vines of merlot.
