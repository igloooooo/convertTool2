            In his previous life, Darren Burke worked as an intensive care nurse around Australia and in the UK, but at the age of 30 he fell to the allure of wine and enrolled in the Bachelor of Applied Science (Oenology) at Adelaide University. Thereafter he successively became graduate winemaker at Orlando, then Alkoomi Wines (he had done a vintage there during his undergraduate studies), fitting in a vintage in Chianti. With two successful vintages in 2005 and 06 completed, and the impending birth of Darren and wife Tammys first child, they decided to move back to the east coast. There he worked at several wineries on the Bellarine Peninsula before taking up his full-time winemaking post at Leura Park Estate. Says Darren, The essence of Bromley is is family. All our wines carry names drawn from our family history. Family is about flesh and blood, sweat and tears, love and laughter. It is all of these things that we bring to the table when we make our wines.
