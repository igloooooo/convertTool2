            Normanby Wines, owned by Thomas and Jennifer Hall, is about 50km due south of Ipswich, and fills in more of the Qld viticultural jigsaw puzzle. The vineyard has just under 3ha planted to verdelho, shiraz, merlot, viognier, chambourcin, durif and grenache, with sustainability the key aim.
