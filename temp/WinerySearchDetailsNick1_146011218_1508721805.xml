            Harald and Coral Brodersen purchased the 40ha Cimbria property in 1990, and planted 3ha of sauvignon blanc and 2ha of cabernet sauvignon in 96, followed by more recent and smaller plantings of merlot, shiraz and viognier. The name and label design were inspired by the link between Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Surveyor-General of NSW, who served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars against Napoleon alongside Willem, Prince of Orange, who was aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington. It was Mitchell who named the town Orange in honour of his friend, who had by then been crowned King Willem II of The Netherlands.
