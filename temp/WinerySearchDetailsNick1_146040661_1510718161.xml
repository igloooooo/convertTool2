            In 1995 Tim Windsor (a CSU winemaking graduate) and wife Jessie (an industrial chemist) purchased the old Black Creek picnic racetrack at the northern end of McDonalds Road in Pokolbin. The first vines were planted in 1996, and planting has continued: to date shiraz, semillon, chardonnay, tempranillo, tinta cao and touriga nacionale are in the ground.
