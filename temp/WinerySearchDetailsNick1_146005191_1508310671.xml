            Steve and Ann Marie Olsen have planted cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, semillon, verdelho and shiraz, which they tend with the help of their four children. It was the desire to raise their children in a healthy country environment that prompted the move to establish the vineyard, coupled with a long-standing dream to make their own wine. Not to be confused with Olsen Wines in Melbourne.
