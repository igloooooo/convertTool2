            Established by Bob and Una Gray, who produced some of the Granite Belts finest honeyed Semillon and silky, red berry Cabernet Sauvignon, it was purchased by Kime and Bobbi Cragg in 2002. The winery incorporates a spacious restaurant, and there are also barbecue and picnic facilities. A most impressive line-up (the first tastings for some years) for this edition.
