            Moojelup Farm is a historic 40ha property dating back to the 1870s. The family of present owners, Stephanie and Simon Holthouse, have owned the property for more than half its history. In 1997 they began planting semillon, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz; some of the grapes are sold to Millbrook Wines in the Perth Hills, with increasing amounts made for Moojelup Farm.
