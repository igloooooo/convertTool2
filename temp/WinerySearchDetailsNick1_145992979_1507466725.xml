            This is a small side venture to Hamelin Bay, also owned by Mainbreak Wines proprietors Richard and Roslyn Drake-Brockman. The grapes are sourced from the southern end of the Margaret River and the business has grown under the direction of winemaker and keen surfer Julian Scott. The label underlines the association between the region and its outstanding surf beaches.
