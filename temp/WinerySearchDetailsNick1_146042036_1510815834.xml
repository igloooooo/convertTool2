            Dr Bruce Jones, and wife Mary, purchased their 16ha property many years ago; it falls within the Yarra Ranges Shire Councils jurisdiction but not within the Yarra Valley wine region. In 1992 they planted 1ha of sauvignon blanc, small patches of shiraz and a few rows of semillon. Over 1ha of sauvignon blanc and pinot noir followed in 1996 (mostly MV6, and some French clone 114 and 115), with yet more 114 and 115 pinot noir in 2000, lifting total plantings to 3.2ha of pinot noir, 1.4ha of sauvignon blanc and a splash of the other two varieties. The Three Wise Men label was conceived to make a top-quality single-vineyard Pinot Noir grown at Woongarra Estate, and now includes other varieties.
