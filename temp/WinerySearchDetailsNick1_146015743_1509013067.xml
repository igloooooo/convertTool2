            Rockfield Estate Vineyard is very much a family affair. Dr Andrew Gaman wears the hats of chief executive officer and co-marketing manager, wife Anne is a director, son Alex is the viticulturist, and Anna Walter (ne Gaman) helps with the marketing. Chapman Brook meanders through the property, the vines running from its banks up to the wooded slopes above the valley floor. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year. Exports to the UK and China.
