            Peter Comisel and Dot Hollow have acquired Sandy Farm from founder Peter Covell. There are 1.5ha of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot and 0.5ha of pinot noir, with a small, basic winery in which they make preservative-free Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot Noir, attracting a loyal local following.
