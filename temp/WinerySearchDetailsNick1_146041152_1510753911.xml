            This is a modern version of a co-operative winery. Forty-five growers across the Adelaide Hills, Barossa Valley and Riverland, with 250ha of grapes, supply the winery. They are also investors in the winery and have direct or indirect board representation. The directors bring together skills as grapegrowers, winemakers and international marketers and distributors. Thus the board is involved at every level, from growing to harvesting, winemaking and marketing of the portfolio. Exports to the UK, the US, Germany, Korea, Hong Kong, China and NZ.
