            When the Gardner family acquired Spring Farm Estate, it had 0.5ha of shiraz and 0.3ha of grenache planted around 1910, and a further 0.3ha of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir planted in 70. In 2000 they ceased selling the grapes and established Adelina Wines. Winemakers Jennie Gardner and Colin McBryde have a broad background, from winemaking and cellar experience to medical research and hospitality, both having worked in numerous regions in New and Old World wineries over the past 10 years. Both are currently completing their doctorates in oenological science at the Adelaide University, studying yeast metabolism.
