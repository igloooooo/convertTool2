            Andrew Caillard MW has had a long and varied career in wine, including vintage work at Brokenwood and elsewhere, but has only just taken the final step of making his own wine, with the support of wife Bobby. Andrew says the inspiration to make Mataro came while writing the background for the various editions of the Penfolds The Rewards of Patience tastings. Apart from anything else, he learnt that both Max Schubert and John Davoren had experimented with the variety, and that the original releases of Penfolds St Henri comprised a fair percentage of mataro. For good measure, Andrews great (times four) grandfather, John Reynell, planted one of Australias first vineyards: at Reynella, around 1838. No wines were received for the 2013 edition, the rating is that of last year.
