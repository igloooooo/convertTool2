            Ian and Gwenda Langford commenced planting their vineyard in 1999, the majority to shiraz (8.5ha), cabernet sauvignon (3.4ha) and merlot (3.4ha), with a little over 0.5ha each of petit verdot, viognier and mourvedre. The vineyard operates using sustainable principles: prunings are mulched and returned to the vineyard rows along with bunch stalks and pressings. The wines are made in open half-tonne vats, basket-pressed and matured in French oak. Natural (wild) yeast fermentation is employed to capture the uniqueness of the terroir. The wines appear on the wine lists of many prestigious Melbourne restaurants. Exports to the US and China.
