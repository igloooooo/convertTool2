            This is a partnership between Tom and Rebecca Keelan and David and Vanessa Blows. Tom was for some time manager of Longview Vineyards at Macclesfield in the Adelaide Hills, and consulted to the neighbouring vineyard, owned by David and Vanessa. In 2004 Tom and David decided to make some small batches of Petit Verdot and Tempranillo at the Bremerton winery, where Tom is now vineyard manager. The wines are sourced from grapes grown on their Macclesfield vineyards; the remainder of the grapes supply brands such as Shaw &amp; Smith, Penfolds and Orlando.
