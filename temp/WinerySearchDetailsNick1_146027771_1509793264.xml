            Tallarook has been established on a property between Broadford and Seymour at an elevation of 200â€“300 m. Since 1987, 11 ha of vines have been planted, mainly to chardonnay, shiraz and pinot noir, but with significant amounts of marsanne, roussanne and viognier. The second label Terra Felix was sold in 2005, and the quality of the Tallarook wines has risen significantly. The 2007 vintage was destroyed by frost, an unfortunately common story. Exports to the UK and Germany.
