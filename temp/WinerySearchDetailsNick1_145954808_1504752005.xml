            Candlebark Hill, established by David Forster at the northern end of the Macedon Ranges, has magnificent views over the Central Victoria countryside north of the Great Dividing Range. The 3.5ha vineyard is planted to 1.5ha of pinot noir, 1ha each of chardonnay and the three main Bordeaux varieties, and 0.5ha of shiraz and malbec. The Reserve Pinot Noir has been especially meritorious.
