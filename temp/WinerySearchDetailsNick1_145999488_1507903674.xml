            Chris Harvey and wife Sally Beresford purchased the Mirrabooka property in 1999, part of one of the earliest dairy farms established in the Southern Highlands in the 19th century. They run one of the few remaining Holstein cattle studs in the region, but also planted 2ha each of merlot and pinot gris. The cellar door is a replica of the original dairy, but also includes the relocated barrel produce store (circa 1918) used to restore provincial antique furniture for sale in Sallys antique shops (and the cellar door, of course).
