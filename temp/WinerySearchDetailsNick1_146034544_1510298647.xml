            Underground winemakers indeed: Adrian Hennessy, Jonathon Stevens and Peter Stebbing started the business seven years ago, but have only now surfaced in the Wine Companion database. Each has made wine in Alsace, Burgundy, Northern Italy and Swan Hill. Each has extensive experience in the vineyards and wineries of the Mornington Peninsula. And each has either been laid off or dismissed by Fosters. Their first step in 2004 was to lease a small winery at Mt Eliza that had closed years earlier, but still had a vineyard with some of the oldest plantings of pinot noir, pinot gris and chardonnay on the Peninsula. A 1 tonne basket press and a tiny crusher processed 100150 tonnes of grapes in each of the first four vintages. Their portfolio is nothing if not eclectic: Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the Mornington Peninsula, and Durif, Moscato, Cabernet Merlot and Shiraz from Northern and Central Victoria. Exports to Guyana.
