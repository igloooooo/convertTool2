            The Goodchild family has been growing grapes in the heart of the Eden Valley since the 1920s; since that time four generations of the family have been involved, with third-generation Chris and Zvonka expanding the plantings to the current level, with shiraz, chardonnay, riesling and merlot. In 95 Chris began producing small amounts of Shiraz and Merlot for personal use and gifts for friends. In 2006 Chris daughter Steffani and husband Aaron Promnitz joined the family business, together producing The Delinquent (Shiraz). It comes from a single 4ha block (planted in 98), with the best 4 tonnes of shiraz taken for the label.
