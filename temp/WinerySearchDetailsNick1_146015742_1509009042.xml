            A native of WA, Tim Burvill moved to SA in 1993 to do the winemaking course at the Adelaide University Roseworthy campus. Having completed an honours degree in oenology, he was recruited by Southcorp and quickly found himself in a senior winemaking position, responsible for super-premium whites including Penfolds Yattarna. He oversees the team that makes the RockBare wines under lend-lease arrangements with other wineries. Has moved to a new cellar door in the centre of Hahndorf. Exports to all major markets.
