            When George and Deirdre Cremasco commenced the establishment of their vineyard (chardonnay, nebbiolo and prosecco), they did so with the help of Georges father and grandfather. Strongly influenced by their Italian heritage, the vineyard has been terraced, with Chardonnay the first wine in production, and some commendable Nebbiolo and Prosecco following in its footsteps.
