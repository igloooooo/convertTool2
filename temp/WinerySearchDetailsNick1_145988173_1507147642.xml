            When Matt Hunter was looking for a lifestyle change he left his position as Dean, Faculty of Business, Swinburne University and searched for land around the cool, granite soil, apple-growing district of Harcourt. He planted vines in 1985 and kept the vineyard small enough so that he could personally control both the vineyard and winemaking (with help from the wine science course at CSU). Exports to Canada.
