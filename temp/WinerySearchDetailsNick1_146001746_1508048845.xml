            Mudgee Wines has a long history, indirectly dating back to Andreas Kurtzs establishment of vineyards in 1856. Under the management of interim owner Jennifer Meek the vines were grown organically,and the wine was made naturally in the full sense of that term, ie no sulphur dioxide was used. With the acquisition of the business by the Conway family, conventional viticulture and winemaking practises have been resumed, winemaking in the hands of Italian-trained Luciano Lombardini, who circuitously found his way to Mudgee by working with the Lowe Family and thereafter Pieter van Gent. No less than 23 wines were submitted for the 2013 edition, including Cellar Reserve wines made before the arrival of Luciano.
