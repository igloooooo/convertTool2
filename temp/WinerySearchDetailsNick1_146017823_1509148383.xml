            Robert and Margaret McDonald run a combined luxury B&amp;B operation in tandem with a vineyard planted to pinot gris, pinot noir and gewurztraminer. The accommodation is set at the end of the vineyard, with up to six people accommodated in two luxury villa units. A forest trail leads from the vineyard to the Sailors Falls waterfalls and many other attractions typical of the beautiful Daylesford area.
