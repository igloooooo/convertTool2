            Just when I expected it least, Lindemans has produced some seriously good wines from the Hunter Valley, and one half of the Lindeman winemaking or marketing side (without talking to the other half) has exhumed some of the Bin number systems that were used in the glory days of the 1960s, admittedly without total consistency. Thus for white wines, 50 or 55 were the last two digits used for what was named Riesling, 70 for what was named White Burgundy, and 75 for what was called Chablis; with the shiraz-based wines, the last two digits were either 00, 03 or 10. The most famous were the 1965 Claret and Burgundy releases Bin 3100 and Bin 3110, the most famous Chablis 1967 Bin 3475. Enquiries about the present system were, it seems, not understood. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
