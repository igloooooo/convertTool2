            Stone Bridge Wines started out as a hobby but has turned into a commercial enterprise for its owners, Craig and Lisa Thomson. They say that Craigs 16 years as a baker have assisted in the art of winemaking:Its all about the mix. Their own patch of shiraz provides only a small part of the annual crush; riesling, pinot gris, cabernet sauvignon and malbec are purchased from local growers. The cellar door is a rammed-earth and iron building with picturesque surrounds, where on Sundays SeptMay (weather permitting), visitors can relax and enjoy a gourmet wood-oven pizza.
