            This is the project of the Faith Lutheran School, which began making small batches of wine in 1992 as part of the Year 10 agricultural studies program. Stuart Blackwell of St Hallett monitored the program for many years, during which time the crush grew from 0.5 tonne to over 20 tonnes. Faith became the first school in Australia to construct a purpose-built winery: the Faith Wine Education Centre opened in 2002. The executive manager in charge is Bob Mitchell, agricultural co-ordinator and winery manager.
