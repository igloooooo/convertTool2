            The Connellan family (Margaret and Tony plus children Michelle, Peter and Louise) began planting the Rimfire Vineyards in 1991 as a means of diversification of their large cattle stud in the foothills of the Bunya Mountains, northeast of Toowoomba. The vineyard is planted to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, ruby cabernet, cabernet franc, sangiovese, touriga nacional and graciano, all between 1ha and 1.5 ha. The wine simply called 1893 is made from a vine brought to the property by a German settler in about 1893; the vineyard ceased production in the early 1900s, but a single vine remained, and DNA testing has established that the vine does not correspond to any vine cultivar currently known in Australia. Rimfire propagated cuttings, and a small quantity is made each year.
