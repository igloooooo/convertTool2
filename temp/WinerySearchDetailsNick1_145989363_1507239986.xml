            Lethbridge was founded by scientists Ray Nadeson, Maree Collis and Adrian Thomas. In Rays words,Our belief is that the best wines express the unique character of special places. As well as understanding the importance of terroir, the partners have built a unique straw-bale winery, designed for its ability to recreate the controlled environment of cellars and caves in Europe. Winemaking is no less ecological: hand-picking, indigenous yeast fermentations, small open fermenters, pigeage (foot-stamping) and minimal handling of the wines throughout the maturation process are all part and parcel of the highly successful Lethbridge approach. Ray also has a special touch with chardonnay, and has a successful contract winemaking limb to the business. Exports to the UK.
