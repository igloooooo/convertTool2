            A vineyard devoted entirely to shiraz has been established on part of a family-owned farm founded by Henning Rathjen in 1858. He first planted vines in the 1860s, and award-winning wines were made at the property throughout his lifetime. The vines were removed in the 1920s in favour of broad acre farming, but in 1998 Finlay and Darryl Rathjen (third- and fourth-generation descendants) replanted vines on the original site, and Henning Rathjens historic cellar once again houses wine. Most of the grapes are sold, but part made by Sergio Carlei for the Hennings View label.
