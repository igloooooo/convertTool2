            Providence incorporates the pioneer vineyard of Frenchman Jean Miguet, now owned by the Bryce family, who purchased it in 1980. The original 1.3ha vineyard has been doubled, and unsuitable grenache and cabernet (from the original plantings) have been grafted over to chardonnay, pinot noir and riesling. Miguet called the vineyard La Provence, reminding him of the part of France he came from, but after 40 years the French authorities forced a name change. The cellar door offers 70 different Tasmanian wines.
