            Andrew Cottell and Joy Carlisle have a tiny vineyard on a steep, sunny, exposed slope adjacent to their house, and a micro-winery (which has approval for a total crush of 15 tonnes), but they take the venture very seriously. Andrew studied wine science and viticulture at CSU, where he was introduced to the Italian varieties; this led to the planting of arneis, nebbiolo, vermentino, negro amaro and dolcetto. An attempt to use an organic spray program in 2002 failed, and while adopting integrated pest management, soft environmental practices and beneficial insects, they have moved to conventional vineyard management.
