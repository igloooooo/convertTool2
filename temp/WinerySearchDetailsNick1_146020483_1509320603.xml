            After a change of ownership in 2007, Settlers Rise has closed its Montville site, and has moved its operations to Maleny Manor (a luxurious wedding and accommodation function centre) and expects to open a cellar door. One ha of chambourcin has been established at the property, and another 6ha vineyard is leased.
