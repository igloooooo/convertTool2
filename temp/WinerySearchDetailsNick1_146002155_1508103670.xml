            M. Chapoutier Australia is the eponymous offshoot of the famous Rhne Valley producer. Having disposed of its plantings in Mount Benson, the business now focuses on vineyards in the Pyrenees, Heathcote and Beechworth, with collaboration from Ron Laughton of Jasper Hill and Rick Kinzbrunner of Giaconda. After first establishing a vineyard in Heathcote adjacent to Jasper Hill (see La Pleiade), Chapoutier purchased the Malakoff Vineyard in the Pyrenees to create Domaine Terlato &amp; Chapoutier (the Terlato &amp; Chapoutier joint venture was established in 2000 with its first vintage in 04; Terlato still owns 50% of the Malakoff Vineyard). In 09 Michel Chapoutier purchased two neighbouring vineyards, Landsborough Valley and Shays Flat, all three sites within 5km of each other; all these are now fully owned by Domaine Tournon. (Domaine Tournon consists of Landsborough and Shays Flat estates in the Pyrenees and Ladys Lane estate in Heathcote.) No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year. Exports to all major markets.
