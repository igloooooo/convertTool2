            Grace Farm is a 47ha property purchased in 2003 by Perth businessman John Mair and wife Elizabeth. It had remained natural forest until 1952, when it was partially cleared to graze cattle; today the remnant forest adjoins a national park. Vineyard planting commenced in 06, the first stage completed in 11. At the start of 12 only one wine was available commercially,?a Sauvignon Blanc Semillon, but Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and a cabernet blend will soon join the range.
