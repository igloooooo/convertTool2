            David Packham has used his background as a research scientist to plan the establishment of Holley Hill. He served his apprenticeship with Sergio Carlei at the Green Vineyards for two years before acquiring the then-two-year-old vineyard. The vineyard is planted to chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and pinot noir, supplemented by purchased grapes.
