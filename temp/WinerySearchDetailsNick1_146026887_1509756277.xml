            Swinging Bridge was founded by Mark Ward, who immigrated to Australia in 1965 from the UK with an honours degree in agricultural science from Cambridge University. He has been succeeded by Tom and Georgie Ward. The vineyard is part of a farming property, Gayton, 10km from Canowindra. The name comes from a suspension walking bridge that crosses the Belubula River at the foot of the vineyard. Since the first wines were made in 1997, Swinging Bridge has had considerable wine show success.
