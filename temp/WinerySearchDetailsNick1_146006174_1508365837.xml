            This is a somewhat challenging name for a wine business that, while having a 30ha planting of cabernet sauvignon in Padthaway, has been a virtual winery between 2002 and 06, with two Cabernet Shiraz blends made in 02 (Southern Roo and Scrub Paddock) and two Shirazs in 04 (Lizard Flat and 1 Mile Dam). Some of the information suggests these were made by a number of winemakers in the district (Padthaway) and the Barossa Valley, although the OLeary Walker winery is in fact situated in the Clare Valley. It would seem that a significant part of the production is exported (China and Singapore).
