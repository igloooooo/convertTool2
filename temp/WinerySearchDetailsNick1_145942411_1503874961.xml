            Amulet Vineyard, established and owned by Sue and Eric Thornton, was a pioneer of Italian varieties in the region. These, together with French varieties, are planted on the elevated, cool site set among hills and bush land. The wine is sold under two labels, the scarecrow label representing value (priced under $20), the wood duck label for reserve wines.
