            One time Roseworthy dux Joe Grilli has always produced innovative and excellent wines. The biennial release of the Joseph Sparkling Red (in its tall Italian glass bottle) is eagerly awaited, the wine immediately selling out. Also unusual and highly regarded are the vintage-dated extra-virgin olive oils. However, the core lies with the La Biondina, the Il Briccone Shiraz Sangiovese and the Joseph Cabernet Merlot. The business has expanded to take in both McLaren Vale and Clarendon, with plantings of colombard, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, riesling, merlot, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot gris, sangiovese, nebbiolo and merlot. Exports to all major markets.
