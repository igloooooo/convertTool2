            Leigh Gilligan is a 20-year marketing veteran, mostly with McLaren Vale wineries (including Wirra Wirra). The Gilligan family has just over 4ha of shiraz and 0.4ha each of grenache, mourvedre, marsanne and roussanne, selling part of the production. In 2001 they persuaded next-door neighbour Drew Noon to make a barrel of Shiraz, which they drank and gave away. Realising they needed more than one barrel, they moved to Maxwell Wines, with help from Maxwell winemaker Mark Day, and have now migrated to Marks new Koltz Winery at Blewitt Springs. Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Thailand, Philippines and Hong Kong.
