            Dorrien Estate is the physical base of the vast Cellarmasters network that, wearing its retailers hat, is by far the largest direct-sale outlet in Australia. It also makes wine for many producers?across Australia at its modern winery, which has a capacity of 14.5 million litres of wine in tank and barrel; however, a typical make of each wine will be little more than 1000 dozen. Most of the wines made for others are exclusively distributed by Cellarmasters. (Chateau Dorrien is an entirely unrelated business.) Acquired by Woolworths in May 2011. Exports to the UK and NZ.
