            Bill and Pam Williams returned to Australia in the early 1990s after seven years overseas, and began the search for a property which met the specific requirements for high quality table wines established by Dr John Gladstones in his masterwork Viticulture and Environment. They chose a property in the foothills of the Victorian Alps on the inland side of the Gippsland Lakes, with predominantly sheltered, north-facing slopes. They planted a little over 5ha of chardonnay (the lions share of the plantings with 3.4ha), sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon and a splash of merlot. In 2003 they sold a business they had developed in Bairnsdale and established a small, modern winery. They are mightily pleased to have secured the services of Alastair Butt (one-time maker at Seville Estate), and no less pleased that the grapes they sold to Shadowfax have produced outstanding wines. Unfortunately wines sent for the 2013 Wine Companion did not arrive.
