            Perth couple Simon and Maaike Berns acquired a 7ha block (with 5ha of vines) at Herne Hill, making the first wine in 1998 and opening a most attractive cellar door facility later in the year. They also own the Wildberry Springs Estate vineyard in the Margaret River region. Consistent and significant wine show success has brought well-deserved recognition for the wines.
