            The Denis family moved to their sheep-farming property, Agincourt, west of Parndana, in 1986. Like many others, the downturn in the wool industry caused them to look to diversify their farming activities, which led to the planting of cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and sauvignon blanc, and to the subsequent release of their Woolybud wines. The wines are available by mail order.
