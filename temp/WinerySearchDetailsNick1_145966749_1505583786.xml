            The Eaglerange property has been in the Ivone family for more than three generations, but it was not until 1995 that Frank and Tiziana Ivone began the establishment of their vineyard, initially planting 2ha each of cabernet sauvignon an merlot, and subsequently riesling, tempranillo and saperavi. The name of the estate comes from the watchful eagles which have always lived in the area surrounding their home. The family motto of Set a stout heart to a steep hill is particularly appropriate for the property.
