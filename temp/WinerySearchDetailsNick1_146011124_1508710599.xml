            While Preveli Wines is a relative newcomer, its owners, the Home family, have lived on the property for three generations. Vince and Greg Home also operate the Prevelly Park Beach Resort and Prevelly Liquor Store, where the wines are available for tasting. Fruit from the vineyard at Rosa Brook (3.5ha of semillon and 1ha each of pinot noir, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc) is supplemented by contracts with local growers. The wines are of impressive quality.
