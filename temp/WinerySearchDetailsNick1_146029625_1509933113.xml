            Steve and Val Hughes gave their vineyard its name to acknowledge their former residence in a street called The Grove, which was in turn part of an olive grove near Perth planted by the monks from the New Norcia Monastery north of Perth. They have planted a fruit salad vineyard, the major varieties being sauvignon blanc (2.65ha), chardonnay (1.5ha), cabernet sauvignon (1.88ha), with lesser but not insignificant plantings of semillon, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot, verdelho, tempranillo and graciano. They run a restaurant, provide accommodation, feature coffee roasting sales and tastings, a gourmet delicatessen, olive oil, spirits (from Margaret River's first legal distillery) and, of course, cellar door sales with a wide range of wines reflecting the fruit salad plantings.
