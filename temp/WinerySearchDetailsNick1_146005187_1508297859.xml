            Mark and Debbie Noack have earned much respect from their neighbours and from the other producers to whom they sell more than half the production from the vineyard on their sheep property. The quality of their wines has gone from strength to strength, Mark having worked particularly hard with his Pinot Noir. The Noacks have added a 2ha vineyard at Denmark to their much older 15ha vineyard at Rocky Gully; this has not prevented them from planting 60 000 native trees, numerous shrubs and acres of perennial grasses.
