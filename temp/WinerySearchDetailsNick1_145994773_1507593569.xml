            Andrew McGee and partner Kerry Smith (the latter the viticulturist) have established 12 ha of vines on the banks of the Goulburn River, the majority planted to shiraz, with lesser quantities of grenache, viognier and mourvedre. Currently, 95% of the production is sold to Mitchelton, where the McGee wines are presently made, but the plan is for the partners to make the wine themselves, and to increase production.
