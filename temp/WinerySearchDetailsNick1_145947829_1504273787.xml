            Bellbrae Estate (and the Longboard Wines brand) was established by friends Richard Macdougall and Matthew di Sciascio. Sharing a common love of wine, surf and coastal life, they decided to establish a vineyard and produce their own wine. In 1998 Richard purchased a small sheep-grazing property with 8ha of fertile, sheltered north-facing slopes on the Great Ocean Road near Bellbrae, and with Matthews help as business associate, Bellbrae Estate was born. Since 2003 all the grapes have been Geelong-sourced. In 11 Matthew di Sciascio retired to concentrate on other business ventures, but remains an interested observer. The appointment of David Crawford as winemaker is a significant move for the business given his winemaking experience.
