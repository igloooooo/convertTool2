            This is the venture of John Marinovich and Anne Greenway, who purchased the vineyard in 2009 after many years of dreaming of becoming vignerons. They acquired a vineyard that had been first planted in 1999, with 2ha of merlot, the remainder shiraz and a little gewurztraminer. They say 'We were not prepared for how beautiful our little vineyard would be. It's located just south of the township of Broke, bordered by the foothills of the Brokenback mountains on one side, and skirted by Wollombi Brook on the other.'
