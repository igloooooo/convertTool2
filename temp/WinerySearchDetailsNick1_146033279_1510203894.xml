            This is the venture of winemaker Luke Houlihan and viticulturist Greg Dunnett. Luke was formerly winemaker at Yarra Ridge and Long Gully Estate, and Greg owns Valley Farm Vineyard. The pinot noir has had several distinguished purchasers over the years, and there has never been any doubt about the quality of the fruit, which is from the dry-grown vines. The partners have put the problems of the 2007 and 09 vintages behind them, with lovely 08s and 10s from the Yarra Valley neatly stitched in with an 07 and 09 Syrah from Heathcote.
