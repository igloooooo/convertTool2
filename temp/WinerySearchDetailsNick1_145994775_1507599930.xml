            Peter McGrath has endured all the hard knocks of establishing an isolated vineyard (no near vigneron neighbours to give friendly advice), which coincided with a drought and the failure of irrigation equipment to arrive when promised. This led to his enrolment in a viticulture course. His first attempt at winemaking produced what he describes as nondescript vinegar, which led to the decision to enrol in a winemaking course. All this transpired between 1999 and 2003, and thereafter he achieved modest show success in cool climate and small winemaker wine shows. His estate-grown shiraz, cabernet and riesling is supplemented by purchased chardonnay from the Bathurst area.
