            Jason Brown and wife Alecia, with backgrounds in fine wine retail and accounting, purchased Moppity Vineyards in 2004; it was then already 31 years old. Initially they were content to sell the grapes to other makers, but that changed with the release of the 06 Shiraz, which won top gold in its class at the London International Wine &amp; Spirit Competition. In Nov 09 the 08 Eden Road Long Road Hilltops Shiraz, made from Moppity Vineyards grapes, won the Jimmy Watson Trophy. These awards are among a cascade of golds for its Shirazs, Riesling,Tumbarumba Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. The consequence has been that production (and sales) have soared, and all of the grapes from the estate are now used for the Moppity Vineyards brand. The Lock &amp; Key range provides exceptional value for money. Exports to the UK and China.
