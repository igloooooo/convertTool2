            Ian and Shirley Peterson were among the early followers in the footsteps of Max Lake, contributing to the Hunter Valley renaissance which has continued to this day. Grapegrowers since 1971 and winemakers since 81, the second generation of the family, headed by Colin Peterson, now manages the business. It has been significantly expanded to include 16ha at Mount View, a 42ha vineyard in Mudgee (Glenesk), and an 8ha vineyard near Armidale (Palmerston), each with its own cellar door.
