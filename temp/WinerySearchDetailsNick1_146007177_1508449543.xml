            Former property developer James Bate has followed in the footsteps of the late Sid Hamilton (who established Leconfield in Coonawarra when he was 80) by starting Patterson Lakes Estate not long before he turned 80. The original planting was of 3 ha of shiraz, with a further 3 ha of shiraz, 0.8 ha each of viognier and tempranillo, a patch of cabernet franc, petit verdot, and merlot for a Bordeaux blend, and small amounts of mourvedre, cinsaut and grenache to go with the shiraz. A small winery was completed in 2004. Sullivan Wine Agencies handles the domestic distribution; exports to the US.
