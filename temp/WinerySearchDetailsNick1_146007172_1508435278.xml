            The Paterson family began developing the vineyard in 1996, with shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. It is a powerful team: Robert Paterson (M.Ec.  Sydney, PMD  Harvard) was a Senior Vice-President of Coca-Cola and his wife Rhondda was a teacher, before both turned to cattle farming in the early 1980s and grapegrowing in the mid-90s. Son Stuart has a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of NSW, and has studied viticulture and wine science at CSU in Wagga; wife Rainny is an architect. Most of the grapes grown elsewhere in Gundagai are sold to major wine companies for blended wines; Patersons is one of the few estate-based operations. Exports to Germany.
