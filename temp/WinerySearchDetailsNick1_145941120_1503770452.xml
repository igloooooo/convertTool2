            Eric and Jenny Semmler have been involved in the wine industry since 1986, and have a special interest in fortified wines. Eric previously made fortified wines for Hardys at Berri Estates, and worked at Brown Brothers. Jenny has worked for Strathbogie Vineyards, Pennyweight Wines, St Huberts and Constellation. They have planted micro-quantities of varieties specifically for fortified wines: palomino, durif, tempranillo, muscat a petits grains, tinta cao, shiraz, tokay and touriga nacional. Notwithstanding their Riverland GI, they use minimal water application, deliberately reducing the crop levels, practising organic and biodynamic techniques. In 2011 they purchased the 12.3ha property at Loxton they now call 809 Vineyard, and have taken a further 2ha under management. The 919 vineyard is certified biodynamic; the 809 vineyard is in pre-certification.
