            Col and Cynthia Jardine began the development of their 8.5ha vineyard in 1999, planting 4ha of shiraz, 3ha of cabernet sauvignon and 1.5ha of pinot noir. Col Jardine, who doubles up as viticulturist and winemaker, uses sustainable management practices, and limits the yield to no more than 2 tonnes to the acre.
