            The Brand family story starts with the arrival of Eric Brand in Coonawarra in 1950, when he married Nancy Redman and purchased a 24ha block from the Redman family, relinquishing his job as a baker and becoming a grapegrower. It was not until 66 that the first Brands Laira wine was made. The Brand family sold the Brands Laira winery in 94 to McWilliams, Jim Brand staying on as chief winemaker right up until he died in 2005, after a long battle with cancer, unable to fulfil his ambition to make quality wine under his name. His son Sam, with help from locals, including Bruce Gregory at Majella, has now realised his fathers dream, with the release of the 08 and 09 wines, made from the familys holding of 8ha of cabernet sauvignon, and 1.5ha of shiraz.
