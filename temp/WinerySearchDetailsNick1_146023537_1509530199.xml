            Philip Reid and Margie Ringwood purchased the former Pibbin vineyard and winery (excluding the brand name and stock) in 2001. It is one of a handful of onsite wineries in the Adelaide Hills; very few licences have been issued due to the desire to protect the quality of the ground water, which is an important source of Adelaides water supply. The 6ha vineyard is planted to merlot, pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and viognier, and the grape intake is supplemented by purchases from Adelaide Hills growers, and from the Riverland and Adelaide Plains for the Rose and Shiraz (at lower price points).
