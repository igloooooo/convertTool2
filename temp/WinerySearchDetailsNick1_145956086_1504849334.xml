            John Casas has established 5 ha of shiraz, 4 ha of cabernet sauvignon and 1 ha each of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc. The vineyard is managed to produce low yields of 1–2 tonnes per acre, with the aim of making a wine of sufficient power and density to merit barrel maturation of 1.5–2.5 years. Domestic distribution by the quirkily named Medicinal Purposes Wine Co supplements website sales. Exports to the UK and the US.
