            Planting of the Jinks Creek vineyard antedated the building of the winery by 11 years, but all of the wines are made from estate-grown grapes. Perched above the vineyard with an uninterrupted view of the Bunyip State Forest and Black Snake Ranges, a refurbished 100-year-old wool shed has been renovated to house a restaurant, art gallery and cellar door. This venue is constructed entirely from recycled materials sourced from Gippsland, including old lining boards, a kauri pine dance floor and a perfectly preserved pressed-tin ceiling. Huge industrial steel windows open onto an outer deck, next to the sculpture garden and contemporary artworks by well-known Australian artists including Esther Erlich, Christopher Lees, Willy Sheather and Mark Knight. Open on Sundays for wood-fired pizza and wine tasting, the venue is available for private functions by arrangement, and a nearby Victorian weatherboard cottage provides secluded accommodation above the vineyard. Exports to the US.
