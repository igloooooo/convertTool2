            This captures the delights of the Mornington Peninsula in so many ways. As the name suggests, it is as much a garden as it is a vineyard; Di and Doug Johnson have established a walled garden and increased the existing 0.5ha of pinot noir (planted in 1989) by an additional 1ha of pinot noir and 0.5ha of pinot gris.
