            The striking name and label design is the work of Owen Latta, whose family planted Eastern Peake in 1983. Owen was born during the first growing season of that vineyard and has always been involved in Eastern Peake. Indeed, aged 15, and while still at school, he took control of the winemaking when his father suffered concussion after a fall in the winery that vintage. Since then he has travelled widely, making wine in Burgundy, the Yarra Valley, Geelong and the Pyrenees, experience that has led to contract and consulting work. His aim is to have a Pinot Noir that is affordable, yet distinctive. He has contracted to purchase pinot noir from four vineyards in the region, all 15 years and older.
