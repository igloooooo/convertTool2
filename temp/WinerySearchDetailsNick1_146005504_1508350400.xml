            Dr Geoff Cutter says his inspiration to start Outram Estate came from Max Lake, a visit to St Emilion/Pomerol in Bordeaux, and my account of the establishment of Coldstream Hills, which he read in one of my books. His aim is to produce quality, not quantity, and with Peter Howland in charge of winemaking, there is no reason why he should not do so. He has 5.5 ha of merlot on rich red volcanic basalt, and 13 ha of verdelho and chardonnay on the sandy grey alluvial soils of Wollombi Creek. Exports to the UK, the US, Fiji and Taiwan.
