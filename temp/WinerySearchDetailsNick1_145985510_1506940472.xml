            Owners Michael Kerrigan and Gavin Berry have been making wine in WA for a combined period of over 40 years, and say they have been most closely associated with the two varieties that in their opinion define WA: riesling and cabernet sauvignon. This is strictly a weekend and after-hours venture, separate from their respective roles as chief winemakers at Hay Shed Hill and West Cape Howe. They have focused on what is important, and explain, We have spent a total of zero hours on marketing research, and no consultants have been injured in the making of these wines. The Riesling is made from the Langton Vineyard in Mount Barker, with some of the oldest riesling vines in WA (planted in the 1970s). The Cabernet Sauvignon is a blend of grapes from Mount Barker (the Landsdale Vineyard) and Margaret River (the Hay Shed Hill vineyard).
