            Three generations of the Hanigan family are involved in the management of their historic Mt Nassau property, owned by the family since 1913. Given that over the last 100 years or so the property has at various times been involved with sheep, cattle, vegetable production, seed crops, poppies, quarrying and the production of lime, the addition of viticulture in 1992 was not surprising. The vineyard has grown in stages, doubling to 10ha in 2003, the grapes bound for Bay of Fires wines and Penfolds Yattarna. The grapes retained by Derwent Estate have produced consistently good wines.
