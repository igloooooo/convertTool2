            This brings together two vastly experienced wine professionals, Leigh Clarnette as winemaker, and Kym Ludvigsen as viticulturist. Their career paths crossed in late 1993 when both were working for Seppelt. Kym has a 14ha vineyard in the heart of the Grampians, all but 1ha of chardonnay, 0.5ha of viognier and 0.25ha of riesling planted to rare clones of shiraz, sourced from old plantings in the Great Western area. Kym is presently the Chairman of the Australian Vine Improvement Association and a board member (and past Chairman) of the Victorian and Murray Vine Improvement Association. He operates a formal consultancy service (details on the website). In 2005 the wheel turned full circle when both were employed by Taltarni.
