            This is the former Vincognita, jointly owned by Peter Belej and Chris Dix. The business was in fact founded by Chris, who had been winemaker with Lindemans for six years, and chief winemaker at Fox Creek Wines for five years. In 2002 Peter joined the business, with primary responsibility for the vineyards, but also with an executive winemaking role. The estate plantings are substantial, and the wines have accumulated an extraordinary number of gold medals and other awards. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year. Exports to China.
