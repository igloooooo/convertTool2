            This is the venture of Taras and Amber Ochota, but dont let the tiny production fool you. Taras has had an incredibly varied career as a winemaker after completing his oenology degree at Adelaide University. He has not only made wine for top-end Australian producers, but has had a Flying Winemaker role in many parts of the world, most recently as consultant winemaker for one of Swedens largest wine-importing companies, working on Italian wines from Puglia and Sicily made specifically for Oenoforos. Amber has accompanied him to many places, working in a multiplicity of technical and marketing roles. His day job now is working for Peter Leske and Mark Kozneds new venture, Revenir, completing another circle, for part of his early career was working with Peter at Nepenthe. The website explains how the Ochota Barrels name came about, and underlines its artisan, low technical input approach. Exports to the US, Sweden and Denmark.
