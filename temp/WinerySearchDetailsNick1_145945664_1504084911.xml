            Richard and Marie Shaw ventured into the wine industry by planting shiraz in the early 1970s at McLaren Flat. They still have the original vineyards and during the Vine Pull Scheme of the 1980s saved several neighbours valuable old shiraz and grenache. Their three sons are also involved in the family business. Extensive vineyards are now held in McLaren Vale (60ha) and Currency Creek (350ha), with a modern winery in Currency Creek. The family produces around 80 000 dozen under the Ballast Stone Estate label as well as supplying others. The wine portfolio impressively over-delivers on value. Ballast Stone opened a second cellar door and caf at Signal Point, Goolwa in 2011. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
