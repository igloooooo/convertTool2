            Kati and Andrew Wenk purchased the former Pibbin Vineyard in 2001, acquiring 20-year-old vines which, with some refurbishment, are producing grapes of very high quality. Both a varietal and Reserve Pinot Noir are made from the 2.8ha vineyard. The wines are made by Andrew Wenks brother Matt, and are being sold through the website, and through restaurants in Adelaide Hills, Mt Hotham and Falls Creek, the link being, according to Kati Wenk, altitude.
