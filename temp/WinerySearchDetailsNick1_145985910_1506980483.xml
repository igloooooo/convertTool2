            Kangaroo Ground, on Melbournes northeast fringe, is home to Australias only post office winery. Winemaker Ken King integrated the local post office into his small winery complex in 2004. As well as sorting the districts mail, Ken nurtures a number of local vineyards and makes all wines onsite at Kangaroo Ground. Kens involvement in winemaking began in 1984 as a member of the Eltham and District Amateur Winemakers Guild. In 88 Ken purchased the 3ha site prized for its rich black volcanic soils that he refers to as chocolate cake. Chardonnay and pinot noir vines were planted in 90 and grapes sold to Diamond Valley until 00. The vines have not been irrigated since 96 and are thriving in the deep soil. Cabernet sauvignon and riesling are sourced from other nearby black soil vineyards. Pesticides are not used and the traditional winemaking process means that the wines are vegan compliant.
