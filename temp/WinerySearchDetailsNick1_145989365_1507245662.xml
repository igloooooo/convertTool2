            Ross and Rina Graham are the new owners of Leven Valley Vineyard, a property that has changed hands several times since its establishment. The vineyard consists of chardonnay and pinot noir on a north-facing slope above the picturesque valley of Gunns Plains. The deep loam over limestone soil holds much promise.
