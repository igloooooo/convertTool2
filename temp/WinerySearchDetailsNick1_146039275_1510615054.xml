            wightwick might be described as an angel on a pinhead exercise. Keith and Ann Wightwick planted the tiny estate vineyard to 0.12ha of chardonnay and 0.29ha of pinot noir in 1996. Son Simon works as a viticulturist and winemaker in the Yarra Valley,and looks after the vineyards on weekends (using organic principles) and the micro-winemaking during vintage. The Pinot Noir is hand-plunged and basket-pressed, with racking via gravity and minimal fining.
