            Egerton (Ege) was well-known in McLaren Vale, starting his vineyard at McLaren Flat in 1947 after serving in the RAAF during the war. Wine production under the Dennis label began in 1971, and in 79 winemaking and management passed to son Peter. The vineyard is planted to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc. Exports to the UK, Canada and Vietnam.
