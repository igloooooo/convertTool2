            The name chosen by owner Richard Bate comes from Greek mythology, describing the aggregate of all the qualities of valour, virtue and excellence that make up good character. Having graduated with a Bachelor of Science (wine science major) from CSU, Richard worked at Barossa Valley Estate, then Saltram,Wolf Blass and Penfolds. His next move was to work for the Burgundian cooper Franois Frres distributing barrels within Australia, before venturing into the challenging world of the small winemaker. His intention is to make single vineyard wines wherever possible, with small quantities of each wine part of the strategy.
