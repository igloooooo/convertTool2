            Oakover Wines is a family-operated winery located in the Swan Valley. Formerly part of Houghton, in 1990 it came under the Yukich familys control as Oakover Estate. Prominent Perth funds manager Graeme Yukich and his family have been involved in the region since Nicholas Yukich purchased his first block of land in 1929. In 2002 Oakover Estate became Oakover Wines and Rob Marshall joined the team as chief winemaker and general manager, overseeing the construction of a new winery and managing the extensive vineyard operations on the property. Today, Oakover is the third-largest winery in the Swan Valley. Oakovers White Label brand is currently sold in over 500 independent liquor outlets in WA and Vic, with expansion into NSW and Qld planned. Exports to China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
