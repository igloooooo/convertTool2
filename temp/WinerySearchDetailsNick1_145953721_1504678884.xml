            Angelo Barbagallo, a post-war migrant, settled on the property in the 1920s. He planted muscat, and began making wine for Italians working in the cane fields, progressively setting up a winery that was to continue in production for 50 years. Now owned by Jeff Harden, and christened Bungawarra (Aboriginal for 'granite rock by shallow water'). The winery has been progressively modernised, new buildings erected and a vineyard planted to shiraz, cabernet malbec, chardonnay, semillon and gewurztraminer has been established alongside the venerable muscat vines, now over 90 years old.
