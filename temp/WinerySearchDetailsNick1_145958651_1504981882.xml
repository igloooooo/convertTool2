            One of the longest-established wineries in the region, Ian Leamon is the second generation of the family to be involved, taking responsibility for winemaking in the 1980s. Chateau has been dropped from the winery name because of export complications. The property was sold in early 2012, but Ian Leamon will continue to make wine, buying shiraz and cabernet sauvignon from regional vineyards. Mail order is still available, but there will no longer be a cellar door. Exports to Singapore and China.
