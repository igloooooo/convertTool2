            For many years Val Dell was the senior wildlife ranger on the central plateau of Tasmania, his wife Jan running the information centre at Liawenee. I met them there on trout fishing expeditions, staying in one of the park huts. They have now retired to the Huon Valley region, having established 0.25ha each of pinot noir and chardonnay overlooking Kettering and Bruny Island, said to be a spectacularly beautiful site. The wines are made for them by Andrew Hood and are sold through the cellar door and Hartzview Cellars in Gardners Bay.
