            This is (yet another) venture for Zar Brooks and his wife Elena. They met during the 2000 vintage, and one thing led to another, as they say. Dandelion Vineyards and Zontes Footstep came along first, and continue, but other partners are involved in those ventures. The lofty aims here are to preserve the best of tradition, the old world of wine, the unique old vineyards of SA, and to champion the best clones of each variety, embracing the principles of organic and biodynamic farming. I dont doubt for one moment the sincerity of the underlying sentiments, but theres a fair degree of Brooksian marketing spin involved. Having said that, the quality of their first wines was outstanding, easily putting Heirloom Vineyards into the Best New Wineries list. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year. Exports to all major markets.
