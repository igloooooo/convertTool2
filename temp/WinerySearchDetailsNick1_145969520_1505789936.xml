            Fern Hill Estate, along with Marienberg and Basedow, became part of the James Estate empire in 2003. A revamping of the packaging and labelling, plus acquisition of grapes from the Adelaide Hills to supplement that of McLaren Vale, has been accompanied by a move away from retail to restaurant/on-premises sales.
