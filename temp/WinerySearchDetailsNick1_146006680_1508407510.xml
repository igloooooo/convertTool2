            The former Moorabool Estate has been renamed Paradise IV for the very good reason that it is the site of the original Paradise IV Vineyard, planted in 1848 by Swiss vigneron Jean-Henri Dardel. It is owned by Ruth and Graham Bonney in partnership with former schoolteacher and wine lover Douglas Neal, who has the agency for various French barrel makers in Australia and South Africa. Douglas is also a self-trained winemaker, and his role in the partnership is to make and sell the wines, with Graham and Ruth responsible for the vineyard, which is planted on decomposed granite over limestone, an ideal structure. In practice, the functions overlap to a degree, as one would expect with a relatively small business. The winery has an underground barrel room, and the winemaking turns around wild yeast fermentation, natural mlf, gravity movement of the wine and so forth.
