            Sue and Rod Hourigan gave up their careers in fabric design and television production at the ABC in 1976 to chase their passion for fine wine. This took them first to McLaren Vale, with Sue working in the celebrated Barn Restaurant, and Rod starting at dArenberg; over the next three hectic years both worked vintages at Pirramimma and Coriole while undertaking the first short course for winemakers at what is now CSU. They then moved to Redesdale in 1979 and established Eppalock Ridge on a basalt hilltop overlooking Lake Eppalock. The 10ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot are capable of producing wines of high quality. Exports to China.
