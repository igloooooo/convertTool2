            The Ritual is the product of a partnership between two Perth wine identities. John Griffiths is winemaker, and Bill Healy owns the 40-ha Orondo Farm Vineyard in Dwellingup, where John obtains much of the grapes for his own (Faber) and other labels. The modest line-pricing and simplicity of the product range reflect no more than sober experience. Exports to the UK and China.
