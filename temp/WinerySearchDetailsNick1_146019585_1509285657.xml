            Seaforth Estate is a family-owned and operated business. Andrew and Venetia Adamson continue to undertake much of the management of their vineyard, which is planted on red volcanic soil at the top of Red Hill. At 300m above sea level, Seaforth Estate is one of the highest vineyards on the Mornington Peninsula, sited on a north-facing slope overlooking Port Phillip Bay to the distant Melbourne skyline. Wines marketed under the Seaforth Estate label are 100% estate-grown and the Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Gris have consistently performed well. In Oct 09 100 chardonnay vines (still leaving 2.4ha) were removed and replaced with three clones of pinot noir, two new to Australia.
