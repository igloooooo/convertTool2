            The foundations for Catspaw Farm were laid back in 1989 when planting of the vineyard began with chardonnay, riesling, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chambourcin and shiraz, totalling 4.6 ha, followed by roussanne, semillon, barbera and sangiovese, which lifted total plantings to just under 8 ha.
