            This is another of the multinational, multi-talented boutique wine operations springing up like mushrooms after autumn rain. The English end is represented by Martin Krajewski (who also owns Chateau de Sours in Bordeaux) and the Australian by David Fatches and John Duval as winemakers. While the red wines are made from McLaren Vale grapes, Songlines is from 110-year-old vines, and the wines are in fact made in the Hunter Valley winery, which takes advantage of 3ha each of chardonnay and semillon to produce estate-based varietal releases. Songlines heads the three-tiered range of wines, followed by Bylines and then Leylines. Exports to the UK, Canada, France and Hong Kong.
