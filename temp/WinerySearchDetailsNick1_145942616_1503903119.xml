            Exemplifies the economies of scale achievable in the Riverland without compromising potential quality. Very good technology provides wines that are never poor and sometimes exceed their theoretical station in life. The vast Nanya Vineyard is currently being redeveloped with changes in the varietal mix, row orientation and a partial move to organic growing. Angoves expansion into Padthaway (chardonnay), Watervale (riesling) and Coonawarra (cabernet sauvignon) via long-term contracts, and the purchase of the Warboys Vineyard in McLaren Vale in 2008, have resulted in outstanding premium wines to back up its Riverland wines. In 2012 Angove celebrated its 125th anniversary, with the opening of a large, modern cellar door and cafe on the Medyk Vineyard at the corner of Chalk Hill Rd/Olivers Rd, open 105 daily. Exports to all major markets.
