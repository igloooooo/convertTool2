            The good news about Winstead is the outstanding quality of its extremely generous and rich Pinot Noirs, rivalling those of Freycinet for the abundance of their fruit flavour without any sacrifice of varietal character. The bad news is that production is so limited, with only 0.8ha of pinot noir and 0.4ha riesling being tended by fly fishing devotee Neil Snare and wife Julieanne. Last years rating is maintained in the absence of a representative submission of its wines for the 2013 edition (one wine was tasted at the Tasmanian Wine Show).
