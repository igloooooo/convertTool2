            Retired engineer Harry Wells began planting the vineyard in 1990, choosing chardonnay, verdelho and shiraz. Initially the grapes were sold, but Harrys daughter Beth and son-in-law Peter Parkinson began producing wines under the Bishop Grove Label. The business has since been acquired by Christopher Hirst.
