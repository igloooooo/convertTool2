            Bristol Farm is a pinot noir specialist; Wayne Condon has established slightly over 1ha of multiple clones of the variety and, for good measure, has not used irrigation in their establishment or ongoing grapegrowing. Montys Paddock is the premium release, made only in the best vintages; Lionheart is the normal label.
