            Wes and Pamela Vine planted their first vineyard at Mandurang in 1976 and started making wine as a hobby. Commercial production began in 93, and an additional vineyard was established in 97. Wes (a former school principal) became full-time winemaker in 99. Son Steve has progressively taken greater responsibility for the winemaking, while Wes is spending more time developing export markets. Pamela manages the cellar door caf, established in 2001 and extended in 05. Expansive lawns and gardens provide the opportunity for visitors to enjoy wine and food outdoors. Exports to China.
