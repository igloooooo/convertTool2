            Another of the micro-vineyards, which seem to be a Tasmanian speciality; Flemming and Jenny Aaberg planted slightly less than 0.5ha of chardonnay and riesling in 1990, and now have 0.5ha each of chardonnay, riesling and tempranillo. The exercise in miniature is emphasised by the permanent canopy netting to ward off possums and birds.
