            Pennyfield Wines is named in memory of the pioneering family which originally developed the property, part of which is now owned by the Efrosinis family. Pennyfield draws on 17.7ha of estate vineyards (principally planted to cabernet sauvignon and shiraz) but is also supplied with chardonnay, merlot, petit verdot, touriga and viognier by four local growers. Exports to the US, Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
