            Owners Christine McDonald, Wendy Sutherland and Peter Robertson began the plantings of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, semillon, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo in 1993. A cellar door has been established in the old Nargoon Woolshed, a showpiece for the region, providing tea, coffee and lunches. Barbecue facilities, a wood-fired oven and camp oven meals are available by appointment, pizzas the last Sunday of each month (bookings essential).
