            Red Hill Estate was established by Sir Peter Derham and family, and has three vineyard sites: Range Road, Red Hill Estate (the home vineyard), and The Briars. Taken together, the three vineyards make Red Hill Estate one of the larger producers of Mornington Peninsula wines. The tasting room and ever-busy restaurant have a superb view across the vineyard to Westernport Bay and Phillip Island. In 2007 it (surprisingly) merged with Arrowfield Estate in the Hunter Valley, both companies thereafter owned by the InWine Group until October 10, when InWine was acquired by Cheviot Bridge. Further wines were received after the 2013 edition went to print. Exports to the US, Canada, Ireland, Poland, Sweden, Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong.
