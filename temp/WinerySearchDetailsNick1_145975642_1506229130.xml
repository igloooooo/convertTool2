            The Grove Estate partners of Brian Mullany, John Kirkwood and Mark Flanders purchased the then unplanted property situated on volcanic red soils at an elevation of 530m with the intention of producing premium cool climate wine grapes for sale to other winemakers. Over the ensuing years plantings included cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, merlot, zinfandel, barbera, sangiovese, petit verdot, chardonnay, semillon and nebbiolo. In 1997 a decision was taken to?retain a small amount of cabernet sauvignon and have it vinified under the Grove Estate label, and the winemaking gathered pace thereafter. Wine names with apologies to Randall Grahm of Bonnie Doon, California.
