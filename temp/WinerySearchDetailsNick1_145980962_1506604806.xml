            Hungerford Hill, sold by Southcorp to the Kirby family in 2002, emerged with its home base at the impressive winery previously known as One Broke Road. The development of the One Broke Road complex proved wildly uneconomic, and the rationalisation process has resulted in Hungerford Hill becoming the sole owner. The quality of the wines has seen production rise from 20 000 to 50 000 dozen, reversing the pattern under prior Southcorp ownership. As the notes indicate, Hungerford Hill now focuses its attention on Tumbarumba and the Hunter Valley, with some wines coming from the Hilltops region. Exports to all major markets.
