            Gained considerable attention for its Pinot Noirs during the 1980s, and continues to produce wines of distinctive style. One of the most engaging promotions in the entire wine industry is the annual Montara Scarecrow Competition held in the vineyard at the end of April, even Cirque du Soleil might gain inspiration. I hope the Stapleton family, who have purchased the winery from the founding McRae family, will not evict the scarecrows. Exports to the US, Ireland and China.
