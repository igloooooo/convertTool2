            If you drive from Sydney to the Hunter Valley by the most conventional and quickest route, Mt Vincent Estate is the first vineyard you will come to, at the foot of Mt Vincent in the Mulbring Valley. The 50ha property includes a 2ha lake stocked with fish and yabbies, a 5-bedroom accommodation retreat, and a sign that normally says closed. The range of wines had extended from Orange to the Hunter Valley to Tasmania, the common factor contract winemaking of the highest order.
