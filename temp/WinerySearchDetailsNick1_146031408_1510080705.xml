            Proprietors Andrew Wardlaw and Peter Clarke weave all sorts of mystique in marketing the Tin Shed wines. They say, our wines are handmade so we can only produce small volumes; this means we can take more care at each step of the winemaking process... most bizarre of all we use our nose, palette (sic) and commonsense as opposed to the safe and reliable formula preached by our universities and peers. The Tin Shed newsletter continues with lots of gee-whizz, hayseed jollity, making one fear the worst, when the reality is that the wines (even the Wild Bunch Riesling, wild-fermented without chemicals) are very good. Exports to the UK, the US, NZ and Japan.
