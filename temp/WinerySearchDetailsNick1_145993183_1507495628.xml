            The 19-ha property was originally an orchard, herb farm and horse stud. After the vineyard was established, the grapes were sold to other wineries in the region until 1998, when the first Mantons Creek wines were made from the 10-ha vineyard planted in 1994. The property was purchased by Dr Michael Ablett, a retired cardiologist, and his wife Judy in 2001. Exports to Hong Kong and Japan.
