            Maximilian and Louise Hruska opened Maximilians Restaurant in 1976 in a homestead built in 1851, and planted 2ha of chardonnay and 6ha of cabernet sauvignon in 1994, surrounding the restaurant. The Cabernet Sauvignon is made by Grant Burge, the Chardonnay at Scarpantoni Estate under the direction of the Hruskas eldest son, Paul. Since graduating from Roseworthy, Paul Hruska has completed vintages in Burgundy, Bordeaux, Spain, Margaret River and the Clare Valley; he was winemaker/vineyard manager at The Islander on Kangaroo Island.
