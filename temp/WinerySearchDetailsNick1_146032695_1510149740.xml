            Toomah Wines is owned and managed by Matt and Michelle Robinson; the 8ha of vineyards have been planted on Matts parents historically important 226ha grazing property. Once owned by the Kitchen family (of Lever &amp; Kitchen fame), the property boasted the largest orchard in the southern hemisphere in its 1930s heyday. Matt Robinson has a Bachelor of Agricultural Science from Melbourne University, and is completing his Bachelor of Applied Science (Wine Science) degree (by correspondence) through CSU. Various historic buildings on the property are being restored: one serves as the winery, the other as cellar door.
