            This is the venture of winemaking couple Damien Stevens and Jodie Belleville, together with Daniel and Elle Hart. It is a virtual winery, the grapes being purchased from single vineyards, and made at First Creek Wines, where Damien and Jodie are full-time winemakers. While total production was little more than 300 dozen, half Semillon and half Shiraz, it hit the headlines in 2010 when its Oakey Creek Semillon won two trophies at the Hunter Valley Wine Show, and went on to win a further gold medal at the Hunter Valley Boutique Wine Show. I get the feeling we shall hear more of this venture in the future.  Exports to the UK.
