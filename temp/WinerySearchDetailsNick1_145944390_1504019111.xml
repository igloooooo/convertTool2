            The Ochota family established a vineyard in the Clare Valley in the 1960s, which eventually led to George Ochota becoming an amateur winemaker in the mid 90s; after winning numerous medals he decided it was time to take the plunge into commercial winemaking, buying grapes from the Clare Valley (including the former family vineyard), Langhorne Creek, McLaren Vale and Barossa.
