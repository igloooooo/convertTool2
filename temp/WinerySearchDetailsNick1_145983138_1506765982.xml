            Andrew Jenner and Jason Webb are long-term friends who have shared a love of wines for over 11 years, and had a goal to own a vineyard and make single vineyard wines. They were able to buy a vineyard in Mintaro in the Clare Valley (where Andrew and his family have long-standing ties), the vines between four and six years old when the vineyard was purchased. It was in need of rehabilitation, and they now have 2ha each of shiraz and riesling, and 1ha of cabernet sauvignon. The Shiraz and Cabernet are from dry-grown vines, and all three wines they produce are from this single vineyard. The medium-term plans are to build a cellar door and a small winery on the block.
