            Bluestone Lane takes its inspiration from the many bluestone-cobbled laneways around Melbourne. From time to time large quantities of bluestone pavings become available for purchase as more modern surfaces are used in the city, and Michael and Pauline Poulter have incorporated these in their much-revitalised and altered property. Wetlands and bush have been rejuvenated, while run-down cattle grazing land now supports the 5ha of vineyard planted in 1997. The present plantings of pinot noir, chardonnay, shiraz, pinot meunier and sauvignon blanc will be increased by a further 4ha divided between pinot gris and additional chardonnay. Mark Poulter brings his long experience as a chef on the Mornington Peninsula into play at the Veraison Restaurant.
