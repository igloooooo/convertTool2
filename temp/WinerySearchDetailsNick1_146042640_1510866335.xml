            This is the Australian operation of Kendall-Jackson, one of the leading premium wine producers in California. In 2000 Kendall-Jackson acquired the 172ha Eringa Park vineyard from Normans Wines (the oldest vines dated back to 1923). The renamed Yangarra Estate Vineyard is the estate base for the operation, which built a state-of-the-art premium red wine facility in 10, and is moving to certified organic status with its vineyards. In 12 it purchased the historic Clarendon Vineyard from the estate of the late Alan Hickinbotham  it had been on the market for $10 million, but the actual price paid was not disclosed. Whatever it may have been, it represents a major endorsement of the prospects for top-quality Australian wines. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
