            Owners Tony and Kay Volpato began planting in 1978, and have continued until recently, shiraz being added to previously established riesling, chardonnay, pinot gris, cabernet, merlot, trebbiano and muscat. The vineyard and winery are located on a ridge, and the Volpatos say one glance at the surrounding Barrabool hills explains the choice made by the early Swiss settlers for establishing their vineyards on this land.
