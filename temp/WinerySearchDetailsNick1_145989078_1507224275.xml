            Former Yalumba senior winemaker Robb Cootes, with a Master of Science degree, opted out of mainstream life when he established Leland Estate, living in a split-level, 1-roomed house built from timber salvaged from trees killed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires. The Sauvignon Blanc is usually good.
