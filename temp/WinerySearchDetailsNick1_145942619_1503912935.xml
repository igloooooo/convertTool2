            Susan and Alistair Angus were pioneer viticulturists on Hindmarsh Island, and established 3.75 ha of shiraz and 1.25 ha of semillon. The wines were of consistently very good quality, but the dramatic reduction in water availability has meant they have had to remove all except 1.25 ha of shiraz. Part is bottled under the Angus Wines label; some is sold in bulk to other wineries. Every aspect of packaging and marketing the wine has a sophisticated touch. Exports to the UK.
