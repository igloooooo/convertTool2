            Gavin and Linda Perry fell in love with Bedarra Island (off the north Qld coast) when they stayed there, hence the name of their property, which they acquired in 1998. They planted 5ha of vines in 1999, and are progressively developing the 21ha holding. In 2007 some of the vines were grafted over to pinot gris, with the first vintage in 09. Exports to China.
