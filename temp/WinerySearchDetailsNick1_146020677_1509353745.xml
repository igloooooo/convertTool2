            Graeme and Ann Shaw established their vineyard (cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz, semillon and riesling) in 1998 on a 280ha fine wool-producing property established in the mid 1800s and known as Olleyville. It is one of the largest privately owned vineyard holdings in the Canberra area, and one of the few to produce 100% estate-grown wines. Their children are fully employed in the family business,Michael as viticulturist and Tanya as cellar door manager. The cellar door offers a wide range of local produce, as well as handmade ceramics from Deruta in Italy. Fifty dollars from each dozen sale from the Laughter Series range is donated to Camp Quality. Exports to The Netherlands, Vietnam, China and Singapore.
