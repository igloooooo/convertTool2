            Bill Sweetlands family crest depicts ears of wheat and bunches of grapes, and the family first settled in the Hunter Valley in the 1820s. Thus Bill says it was inevitable he should start a vineyard, and has done so with pinot noir, with the infinitely experienced Gary Farr as consultant.
