            Kim and Francis Moginie were among the pioneers of the Southern Highlands region when they established Joadja, and began planting 6.5ha of vines around the small winery. There was a difficult and protracted learning curve required to work out which varieties were suited to the region, and, having established that, finding the right blocks on the vineyard. Winemaking, too, threw out challenges of its own. All of these have been overcome, and the winery is fully open for inspection throughout the year, including its self-guided winery tour with signposts explaining the function of each piece or pieces of equipment.
