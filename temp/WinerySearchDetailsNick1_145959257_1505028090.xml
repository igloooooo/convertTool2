            This quaintly named venture is a virtual wine business operated by Craig and Margaret Benjamin, who own and operate the Upper Hunter Wine Centre, with shops in Musswellbrook and Scone also selling horse riding products under the Australian Thoroughbred Racing Shop banner. The wines are purchased from Upper Hunter winemakers and labelled for Chocolate Hills.
