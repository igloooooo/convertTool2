            The business was created by long-term friends David Constable and Michael Hershon; one of its points of attraction is its spectacular formal gardens: the Rose, Knot and Herb, Secret and Sculpture. When Michael died in 2007, David purchased his interests in the property from his estate; he has since replanted half the vineyard, and is actively engaged in a program to increase the quality of the wines and the profile of the business. The varieties planted are cabernet sauvignon, verdelho, semillon, shiraz and chardonnay.
