            The Diloreto family have been growing grapes since the 1960s, with 8ha of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, mourvedre and grenache. The vineyard was founded by father Gesue Diloreto and, like so many Adelaide Plains grapegrowers, the family sold the grapes to SA winemakers. However, at the end of the 1990s, son Tony and wife Gabriell (herself with a winemaking background from the Rhine Valley in Germany) decided they would jointly undertake a short winemaking course. Tony Diloreto entered two wines in the Australian Amateur Wine Show '01, competing against 700 vignerons from around Australia. Both were Shiraz from the 2001 vintage, one with new oak, the other not. Both won gold medals, and the judges strongly recommended that the wines be made and sold commercially. Great oaks from little acorns indeed.
