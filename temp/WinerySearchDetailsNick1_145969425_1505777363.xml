            When, in 1988, Madeleine and Dr David Fenwick purchased a 20ha property between Ocean Grove and Wallington, it was pure chance that it had first been settled by Fairfax Fenwick  no relative. The Fenwicks planted 2ha of pinot noir in 1997 and have since added 2ha of chardonnay and 1ha of shiraz, and increased the pinot noir plantings slightly with three clones (114, 115 and MV6). The first five vintages were contracted to Scotchmans Hill, thereafter split between Scotchmans Hill and Fenwick Wines.
