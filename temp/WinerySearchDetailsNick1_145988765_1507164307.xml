            This is likely to be a once-only entry in the Wine Companion, for it makes its appearance after well-known investment banker Bill Gurry decided to rip out the 120ha of vines he had planted in 1996-97. In the early years, all went well, but then the combination of drought, bushfires and frost suggested grazing cattle might have a positive, rather than negative, cash flow. There are still substantial quantities of wines from 2005 and (mainly) '06 with a price tag between $115 and $119 per dozen.
