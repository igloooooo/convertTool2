            Peter and Anne Spence were sufficiently inspired by an extended European holiday, which included living on a family vineyard in Provence, to purchase a small property specifically for the purpose of establishing a vineyard and winery. It remains a part-time occupation; Peter is an engineering manager at the Ford product development plant in Geelong, Anne a teacher. They have planted 3.2ha on a north-facing slope in a valley 7km south of Bannockburn; the lions share to three clones of shiraz (1.83ha), the remainder to chardonnay, pinot noir and fast-diminishing cabernet sauvignon (it is being grafted over to viognier for use in the Shiraz). The vineyard attained full organic status in 2008 and is moving to biodynamic. The well-priced wines have been made with the sure hand of the fast-learning Peter.
