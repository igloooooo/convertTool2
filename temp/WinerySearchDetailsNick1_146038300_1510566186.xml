            This is the venture of obstetrician and general practitioner David Batt, partner Chris and their five children, no longer a hobby, as one of the daughters is completing oenology studies at Adelaide University. Since purchasing the 64ha farm in 1994, 25ha of vineyard has been planted, to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, riesling, sauvignon blanc, viognier, tempranillo, merlot and petit verdot. The house on the Whale Coast Wines vineyard (built in 1852) is being gradually restored. Most of the grapes have been sold to Cascabel who make the red wines. Exports to the US and the UK.
