            Sons Damien (winery) and Andrew (vineyard) have taken over responsibility for the business from parents Max and Karen. Collectively, they have developed an impressively broad-based product range with a strong cellar door sales base. The Pickled Sisters Caf is open for lunch WedMon (tel (02) 6033 2377). A 20ha property at Rutherglen, purchased in 2007, is planted to shiraz, durif and sangiovese. Exports to China.
