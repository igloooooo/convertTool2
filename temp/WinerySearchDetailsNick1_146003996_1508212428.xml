            Ronald and Elaine Luhrs have 2.7ha of vines, mostly planted back in 1992. The principal varieties are cabernet sauvignon, merlot, malbec, cabernet franc and petit verdot (hence their wines modelled on those of the Medoc in Bordeaux) with a little pinot noir and shiraz. In 2006 they made two interesting blends: a Harslevelu Sauvignon Blanc, and a Mammolo Merlot. They have built a mudbrick cellar door, restaurant and gallery complex.
