            In 1990 Sydney lawyer John Colvin and wife Robyn purchased the De Beyers Vineyard, which has a history going back to the second half of the 19th century. By 1967, when a syndicate headed by Douglas McGregor bought 35ha of the original vineyard site, no vines remained. The syndicate planted semillon on the alluvial soil of the creek flats and shiraz on the red clay hillsides. When the Colvins acquired the property the vineyard was in need of attention. Up to 1998 all the grapes were sold to Tyrrells, but since 99 quantities have been made for the Colvin Wines label. These include Sangiovese, from a little over 1ha of vines planted by John in 1996 because of his love of the wines of Tuscany.
