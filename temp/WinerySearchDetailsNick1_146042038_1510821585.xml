            The 1991 plantings (made by the former Donnington Vineyard) have changed over the years, and, in particular, since the business was acquired by Word of Mouth Wines in 2003. Pinot gris, riesling, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, merlot, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon are all in bearing, and were joined by plantings of petit manseng in the winter of 08. Word of Mouth is the venture of Peter Gibson, Deborah Upjohn, Jamie Gordon and Sharyn Pussell.
