            James Hook, a leading viticulturist, and father Paul have set up a small  perhaps very small is a better description  winery in a converted McLaren Vale garage. The equipment extends to shovels, buckets, open fermenters and a small basket press, and enough French and American oak barrels to allow 20 months maturation. The grapes come from micro-selections from a number of vineyards in McLaren Vale, chosen with great skill. Exports to the UK, the US and Canada.
