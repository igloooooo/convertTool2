            Owners John and Yvonne Pfeiffer, together with daughters Lisa and Tammy, are the fifth and sixth generations of this Barossa winegrowing family. John and Yvonne transformed what was an unviable mixed fruit and farming property into 50ha of mainstream grape varieties; the vineyards are in the Stonewell area, noted for producing high quality shiraz. The grapes were sold for many years, but in 2004 specially selected small parcels were contract-made under the Daughters of the Valley label  dedicated to John and Yvonnes four daughters who, after growing up in the Barossa Valley, have now returned to continue the family business. No releases for the past two years.
