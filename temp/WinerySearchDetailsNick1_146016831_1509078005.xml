            The Rosenzweig family vineyards, some old and some new, are planted to riesling, semillon, chardonnay, grenache, shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. Most of the grapes are sold to other producers, but since 2000 some have been retained and vinified for release under the Rosenvale label. A cellar door opened in 2012. Exports to the UK and other major markets.
