            James and Rhonda Taylor have established 1.35ha of shiraz, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon. The cellar door is situated in the Chiltern Mt Pilot National Park, close to the Woolshed Falls, one of Beechworths main natural attractions. Small quantities of Barbera are sourced from within the region, the Merlot coming from their daughters Cirko V winery (see separate entry). Classy packaging is a feature.
