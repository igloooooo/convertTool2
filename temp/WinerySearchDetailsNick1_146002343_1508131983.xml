            This is an estate-based venture, with 17ha of shiraz, 2ha of cabernet sauvignon and 1ha of tempranillo, all except the tempranillo between 13 and 40+ years old. It is a stand-alone business of the Kaesler family, and the first time it has extended beyond the Barossa Valley. The striking label comes from satellite photos of the vineyard, showing the contour planting; the name Nashwauk comes from Canadas Algonquin indigenous language, meaning land between. The property is situated in the (unofficial) Seaview subregion, with Kays, Chapel Hill and Coriole as its neighbours; they all benefit from sea breezes and cooler nights Exports to the US, Singapore, Malaysia and China.
