            When you read the name of this winery, you expect to find it somewhere on or near the Mornington Peninsula. In fact its a very long way to the North East Victoria Zone, where Barry and Pam Saunders planted 8ha of vineyards on their farm and released the first wines under the name Kooyonga Chapel in 2003. They planted a sensibly focused range of 1.6ha each of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and what started as a hobby has now become a business. Family and friends help with the peak seasons (picking and pruning). Having initially been sold locally under the Kooyonga Chapel brand, the name has been changed and distribution into the Melbourne market has begun.
