            Nigel is a fifth-generation member of the Dolan family, son Tim the sixth: truly, wine is in their blood. Nigels father Bryan enrolled in the first oenology course offered by Roseworthy, graduating in 1949. His 30-year career at Saltram included the capture of the inaugural Jimmy Watson Trophy in 62. There was no nepotism involved when Nigel was appointed chief winemaker of Saltram in 1992, winning major accolades during his 15 years in that role before moving to Wyndham Estate as chief winemaker. Currently he is a consulting winemaker as well as having principal responsibility for Dolan Family Wines. Nigels son Tim is a graduate of the Adelaide University oenology course, and has worked internationally for a number of Flying Winemaker vintages as well as working in Australia for Kangarilla Road, and most recently for Peter Lehmann Wines, close to home in the Barossa Valley. This is a virtual winery business for both, with neither vineyards nor winery  just lots of experience.
