            Michael and Debbie Ryan bought the historic Uplands House (1823) in 1998 and decided to plant the front paddock with chardonnay, joining the grapegrowing trend in the Coal River Valley of southern Tasmania. The vineyard is planted with the two most suitable clones for the area, 8127 for sparkling and the Penfold clone for their lightly wooded Chardonnay. They have developed a partnership with another small vineyard in the valley to produce a Pinot Noir Chardonnay that will spend at least four years on lees prior to disgorgement.
