            This is quite a story. Jo Clifford and Garth Doolan ask the rhetorical question,So how does a couple with four young children stay sane while juggling 2500 fine wool merinos, 120ha of grapes, and 100 000 litres of premium, cool climate wine? In a town such as Castlemaine, the answer is obvious: you just create your own circus troupe! They might have added they enlisted the talents of painter Katharina Rapp to design the striking labels.
