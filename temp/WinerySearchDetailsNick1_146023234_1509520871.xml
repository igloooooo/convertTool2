            SpearGully is the venture of Dr Anthony (Tony) and Michele Jordan, both prominent figures in the Australian wine industry, albeit in different fields. Tony has had a distinguished career, first as a lecturer and consultant, then as CEO of Domaine Chandon, broken for several years as the senior technical director for the worldwide operations of Met Hennessy, before returning to Domaine Chandon and the Yarra Valley. Wife Michele has spent many years in public relations, marketing and sales, based variously in the UK and Australia. They have established chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and pinot noir on the hillsides surrounding their home in the Upper Yarra Valley, and the wines have both domestic and international distribution (the UK and Japan), though in small quantities.
