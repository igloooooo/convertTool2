            This is the venture of the Kelly family, headed by district veteran Michael Kelly, who gained his degree in wine science from CSU before working at Seville Estate and Mount Mary in the Yarra Valley, and Domaine Louis Chapuis in Burgundy, then coming back to WA working for Leeuwin Estate and Sandalford. From there he became the long-term winemaker at Fermoy Estate, but he and his family laid the ground for their own brand, buying prime viticultural land in Caves Road, Yallingup, in 1999. They planted 1.2ha each of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, nebbiolo, vermentino and sauvignon blanc, 1.1ha of chardonnay, and 0.5ha each of malbec and petit verdot. It is an eclectic mix of French, Italian and Spanish varieties, and shiraz from the Geographe region will also be included. Della Fay honours the eponymous Kelly family matriarch.
