            This is a decidedly under the bedcover partnership between Robert Hill-Smith and his immediate family, and Rupert and Jo Clevely, Rupert the former Veuve Clicquot director in Australia, but now running gastro pub group Geronimo Inns in London. Late in 2008 the Hill-Smiths and Clevelys decided (in their words) to do something fun together with a serious dip at Euro styled dry and savoury delicate rose using three site specific, old, low-yielding, dry-grown grenache sites from the Barossa floor. Most of the production is sold in the US, with a small allocation marketed in Australia by Samuel Smith &amp; Son.
