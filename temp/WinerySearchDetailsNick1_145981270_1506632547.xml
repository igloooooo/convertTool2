            Ibis Wines is located just north of Orange on what was once a family orchard. Planting of the vineyard commenced in 1988, and a winery was completed in â€™98. The grapes are sourced from the home vineyards (at an altitude of 800 m), the Habitat Vineyard (at 1100 m on Mt Canobolas) (pinot noir and merlot) and the Kanjara Vineyard (shiraz). Its future is gloomy: urban sprawl and the gradual retirement of owner/winemaker Phil Stevenson suggest its days are numbered.
