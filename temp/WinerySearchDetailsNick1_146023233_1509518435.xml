            Henry and Lucy Rymill are both left-handed, so the choice of name was almost preordained. The same could not necessarily be said of their decision to buy a 6.5ha shiraz vineyard in the Sellicks Foothills at the southern end of McLaren Vale. Henry comes from a distinguished line of vignerons in Coonawarra, and notwithstanding his alarm at a flooding wine lake that may overtake the rising sea  I nurtured a dangerous dream to one day have a vineyard of my own in McLaren Vale. Commonsense, accountants and half of me said dont do it. Its not fair on your family, it will take years to succeed, if at all, and you will become completely despondent. To make it all the more loopy we decided to go biodynamic. Well, its not time for suicide just yet, rather a deserved sense of satisfaction.
