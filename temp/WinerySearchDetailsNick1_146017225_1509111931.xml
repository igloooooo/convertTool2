            Ted and Judy Rafferty expanded their lifetime interest in wine by establishing an experimental 0.8ha vineyard at their Rowans Lane property in 1999, making their first Pinot Noir in 2003. This encouraged them to expand their plantings to 3.6ha at a second site at Dennington, on the banks of the Merri River. To supplement their own production, they have purchased grapes from other leading Henty grapegrowers, each with an impressive track record.
