            Bronwen and David Newbury first became viticulturists near the thoroughly unlikely town of Bourke in western NSW, but in 2001 they moved back to the Great Southern region. The name comes from the adjoining Phillips Brook Nature Reserve and the permanent creek on their property. Riesling and cabernet sauvignon (2ha each) had been planted in 1975, but thoroughly neglected. The Newburys have rehabilitated the old plantings, and have added chardonnay (5ha), merlot, cabernet franc and sauvignon blanc (1ha each).
