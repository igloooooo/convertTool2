            This is a very substantial business that has only come into public focus since 2009. Ten years earlier Geoff and Barb Brown had begun to plant an organically grown vineyard; most was planted in 1999, a small amount in 2001. The grapes were sold under an ongoing contract to Tamburlaine, but in late 08 the owners turned to First Creek Wines, with Liz Jackson the lead winemaker for the new brand, Ascella Pure Wine. The name reflects the Browns belief that organically grown grapes are inherently superior to conventionally-grown grapes, and that the benefit flows through to the wines. Both have fascinating backgrounds outside of the wine industry. Exports to the UK, Canada, Sweden, Japan and China.
