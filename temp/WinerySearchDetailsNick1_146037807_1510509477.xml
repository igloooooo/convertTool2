            Waverley Estate Aged Wines (to give it its full name) is the new name for the Maling Family Estate; as its name suggests, it specialises in offering a range of fully mature wines. Vintages stretching back more than 10 years are available for most of the wines at the cellar door. The wines are chiefly made from the estate plantings (shiraz, semillon, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon). Exports to Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.
