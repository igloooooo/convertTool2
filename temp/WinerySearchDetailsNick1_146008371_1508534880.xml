            Graeme Quigley and Sue Kerrison were wine lovers and consumers before they came to growing and making their own wine. Having purchased a property high on the Mt Camel Range (the name comes from the peregrine falcons that co-habit the vineyard and the ridgeline that forms the western boundary of the property), they progressively planted their vineyard solely to shiraz. Irrigation is used sparingly, with the yields restricted to 2.5 to 3.5 tonnes per ha; the grapes are hand-picked into small baskets, transported direct to small open fermenters and made in small batches. A new cellar door is planned for late 2012.
