            Andy and Beth Boullier have been on the land their whole lives, in various capacities, before buying their small property at Glen Aplin. They have established a little over 1ha of vines, more or less equally split between cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, with a little merlot. They use organic principles in growing the fruit, which is a challenge for themselves, compounded by birds, drought, kangaroos and bushfires. Andy Boullier makes the wine onsite.
