            Italian-born Joe Nardone and English-born John Baker were brought together by the marriage of Joes daughter and Johns son. Both were already in the wine industry, John studying at Roseworthy Agricultural College and establishing a vineyard. The second generation of Frank Nardone and Patrick Baker, the latter having also studied at Roseworthy, now run what is a significant virtual winery, sourcing grapes from all over SA, with contract winemaking by Brian Light at Boars Rock. There are five ranges, headed by The Wara Manta Reserve, followed by Nardone Baker, Blaxlands Legacy, Treeview Selection and then Wara Manta (non-reserve). Exports to the UK, the US, Italy, Singapore, China and Japan.
