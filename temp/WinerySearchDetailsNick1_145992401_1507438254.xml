            Mac Forbes cut his vinous teeth at Mount Mary, where he was winemaker for several years before heading overseas in 2002. He spent two years in London working for Southcorp in a marketing liaison role, then travelled to Portugal and Austria to gain further winemaking experience. He returned to the Yarra Valley prior to the 05 vintage, purchasing grapes for the two-tier portfolio: first, the Victorian range (employing unusual varieties or unusual winemaking techniques); and, second, the Yarra Valley range of multiple terroir-based offerings of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The business has grown steadily, with Tony Fikkers joining the winemaking team, and Dylan Grigg as viticulturist guiding the contract grapegrowers upon whom macforbes relies. Exports to the UK, the US, Dubai and Japan.
