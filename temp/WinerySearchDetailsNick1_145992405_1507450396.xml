            Justin Fahey has established a vineyard planted to pinot noir (three clones), chardonnay (two clones), cabernet sauvignon, merlot, shiraz and viognier. Planting began in 1996, although the first wines were not released until 2004. The vines are grown using organic/biological farming practices that focus on soil and vine health, low yields and hand picking to optimise the quality. Part of the grape production is sold to other Yarra Valley wineries.
