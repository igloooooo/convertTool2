            Walter Clappis (once known as Bill) has been a stalwart of the McLaren Vale wine scene for decades. The estate plantings of shiraz (14ha), cabernet sauvignon (10ha), merlot (9ha) and tempranillo (2ha) are the cornerstone of his new business, which also provides the home for the separately owned Amicus business (see separate entry). Exports to the UK, the US, Canada, Belgium, The Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore, China and Japan.
