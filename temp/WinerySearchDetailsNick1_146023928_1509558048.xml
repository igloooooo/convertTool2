            Phil and Mary Smith purchased their property at Dardanup in 1991, a 20-min drive from the Bunbury hospital where Phil works. They first ventured into Red Globe table grapes, planting 1ha in 19942005, followed by 1ha of mandarins and oranges. With this experience, and with Mary completing a TAFE viticulture course, they extended their horizons by planting 1ha each of cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay in 97, 0.5ha of muscat in 01, and semillon and sauvignon blanc thereafter. Trophy for Most Successful Small Producer, Geographe Wine Show 09.
