            After 15 years at The Lane Vineyard, Helen and John Edwards, and sons Marty and Ben, took an important step towards realising their long-held dream  to grow, make and sell estate-based wines that have a true sense of place. In 2005, at the end of the (now discontinued) Starvedog Lane joint venture with Hardys, they commissioned a state-of-the-art 500-tonne winery, bistro and cellar door overlooking their vineyards on picturesque Ravenswood Lane. Having previously invested in Delatite, and much earlier established Coombe Farm in the Yarra Valley, the Vestey Group (UK), headed by Lord Samuel Vestey and the Right Honourable Mark Vestey, have acquired a significant shareholding in the Lane Vineyard. Exports to all the UK, the US, Belgium, Hong Kong and China.
