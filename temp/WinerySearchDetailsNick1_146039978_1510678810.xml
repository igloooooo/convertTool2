            In 2009 the winery and general operations were passed on to son Daniel Wilson, the second generation. Daniel, a graduate of CSU, spent three years in the Barossa with some of Australias largest winemakers before returning to Clare in 2003. Parents John and Pat Wilson still contribute in a limited capacity, content to watch developments in the business they created. Daniel continues to follow Johns beliefs about keeping quality high, often at the expense of volume, and rather than talk about it, believes the proof is in the bottle. At Daniels side are wife Tamara and daughters Poppy and Isabelle, who help keep the wheels turning behind the scenes. No wines were received for the 2013 edition; the rating is that of last year.
