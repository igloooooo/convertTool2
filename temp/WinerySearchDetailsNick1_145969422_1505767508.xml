            This is the business of Ross and Ronnie (Veronica) Lawrence, who have been fine wine wholesalers in Perth since 1987, handling top-shelf Australian and imported wines. It is a virtual winery, with both grapegrowing and winemaking provided by contract. The wines released in two ranges, the Feet First wines at around $16 a bottle, then three Limited Release wines (Shiraz, Grenache Barbera and Chardonnay) just under $30 a bottle.
