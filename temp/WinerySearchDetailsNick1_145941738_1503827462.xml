            Owners Wally and Judith Atallah have overseen the growth of Allandale from a small cellar door operation to a sound business. Allandale has developed a reputation for its Chardonnay, but offers a broad range of wines of consistently good quality, including red wines variously sourced from Hilltops, Orange and Mudgee. Exports to the UK, Norway, Fiji, Singapore and Malaysia.
