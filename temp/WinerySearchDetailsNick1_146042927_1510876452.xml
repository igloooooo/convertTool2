            Stephen and Rosalind Atkinson established 1ha each of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, and 0.5ha of sauvignon blanc, between 1996 and 97. The vineyard is run on organic principles, with heavy mulching and what is technically termed integrated pest management. Yields are deliberately kept low. The vineyard is situated in what the Atkinsons call the golden mile, 1km to the north of Mount Mary.
