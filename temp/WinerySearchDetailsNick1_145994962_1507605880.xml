            McHenry Hohnen is owned by the McHenry and Hohnen families, sourcing grapes from four vineyards owned by various members of the families. Vines have been established on the McHenry, Calgardup Brook, Rocky Road and McLeod Creek properties. A significant part of the grape production is sold to others (including Cape Mentelle), but McHenry Hohnen has 12 varieties to choose from in fashioning its wines. The family members with direct executive responsibilities are leading Perth retailer Murray McHenry and Cape Mentelle founder and former long-term winemaker David Hohnen. In 2007 David received the inaugural Len Evans Award for Leadership. Exports to the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and NZ.
