            James and Annabelle Tilbrook have almost 5ha of multi-clone chardonnay and pinot noir, plus sauvignon blanc and pinot gris, at Lenswood. The winery and cellar door are in the old Onkaparinga Woollen Mills building in Lobethal; this not only provides an atmospheric home, but also helps meet the very strict environmental requirements of the Adelaide Hills in dealing with winery waste water. English-born James came to Australia in 1986, aged 22, but a car accident led to his return to England. Working for Oddbins and passing the WSET diploma set his future course. He returned to Australia, met Annabelle, purchased the vineyard and began planting it in 99. Finding the best combination of variety and site has proved frustrating; there are plans to graft part of one block to shiraz, and another (possibly) to riesling. The close-planted pinot noir block, with a row width of 1.25m, is being converted to 2.5m by the simple expedient of pulling out every second row.
