            Stephen Junk and Ola Tylestam purchased Estate 807 in 2009; the vineyard had been established in 1998, with plantings of clonally selected pinot noir and chardonnay, plus small amounts of cabernet sauvignon and more recently planted sauvignon blanc. Stephen and Ola (who is Swedish) reside in Denmark, and have three generations of English cocker spaniels, some named on the labels. They also have a herd of alpacas,amazing animals that are very tame and love human company, always happy when children feed them while their parents are tasting the wines.
