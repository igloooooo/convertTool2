            de Mestre Wines, with Paul de Mestre at the head, has established 16ha of low-yielding viognier, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon on a gently sloping, north-facing hill 750m above sea level. The soil, of volcanic origin, is 460 million years old, and also (intriguingly) includes marine deposits. The wines are made and bottled onsite, with full participation of the three de Mestre children.
