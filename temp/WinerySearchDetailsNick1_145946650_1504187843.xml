            David Ritchie and a group of fellow grape and wine enthusiasts established their substantial vineyard in 1997 on a slope facing the mouth of the Broken River and thereon to Mt Stirling. Pinot noir (23ha) and chardonnay (13ha) were planted for Orlando, to be used in sparkling wine. Given the reputation of the region for the production of aromatic white wines, 6ha of riesling were also planted, the intention being to sell the grapes. However, since 2003 some of the best parcels have been kept aside for the Barwite label.
