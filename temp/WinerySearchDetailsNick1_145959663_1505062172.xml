            The derivation of the name Cirko V is, to put it mildly, eclectic. Cirko is Esperanto for circus, and V is an abbreviation of vie, French for life. Inspired partly by Cirque du Soleil and Circus Oz, Kristy Taylor and Peter Lumsden decided to undertake a major seachange, giving up their jobs, selling the various properties they had acquired and moving to the King Valley, buying an existing vineyard planted to 4ha of shiraz, 2ha of merlot and 1ha of viognier. They intend to sell most of the wine through the Tinkers Hill cellar door, and a wine club.
