            David and Lynn Wallace purchased the 10ha property in 2006; it brought with it a long history. In the early years of the last century it was a Chinese market garden, the hand-built ponds remaining today. In 1975 the first chardonnay, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot vines were planted, with further plantings of shiraz in 98; an addition to the cabernet sauvignon the following year brought the vineyard to its present level. The Wallaces (David having studied for his Bachelor of Applied Science (wine science) at CSU) have been progressively rehabilitating and retrellising the vineyard, building a 50-megalitre dam to provide reliable water in the seemingly endless drought years. They say our aims and aspirations are to produce the best-quality grapes we possibly can and eventually produce our own handcrafted wines, give up our day jobs and grow old ungracefully in our beautiful vineyard.
