            Mat and Lisa Henbest have chosen a clever name for their virtual winery  GISA stands for Geographic Indication South Australia  neatly covering the fact that their grapes come variously from the Adelaide Hills (Sauvignon Blanc), McLaren Vale (Shiraz Viognier) and Barossa Valley (Reserve Shiraz). It in turn reflects Mats long apprenticeship in the wine industry, as a child living on his parents vineyard, then working in retail trade while he pursued tertiary qualifications, and thereafter wholesaling wine to the retail and restaurant trade. He then moved to Haselgrove, where he spent five years working closely with the small winemaking team, refining his concept of style, and gaining experience on the other side of the fence of the marketing equation.
