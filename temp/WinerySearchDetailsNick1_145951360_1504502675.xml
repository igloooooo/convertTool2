            Alastair and Michele Graham purchased the 40ha property in 1996, planting the vineyard the following year with sauvignon blanc, followed by merlot, chardonnay and riesling. The wines are estate grown. The name, incidentally, is a pilgrimage town in Algeria built around an oasis: Bou means father and saada peace and happiness. The cellar door is made from Sydney blue gum and local stringybark.
