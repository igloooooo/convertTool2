            Michael Salecich hails from Croatia, where his family has made wine for many generations. His winemaking methods are strongly influenced by the practices of his Croatian family, who he visits each year. He buys his grapes from SA, bringing them to his onsite winery in refrigerated trucks. Here the wines are crushed and fermented, and then matured in shaved hogsheads for three and a half years, in the style of Barolo made the traditional way.
