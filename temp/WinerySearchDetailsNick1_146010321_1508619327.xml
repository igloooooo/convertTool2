            Peter Gibson began Pinnacle Wines in 1999, with the planting of 2 ha of pinot gris on the slopes of Mt Canobolas, at an elevation of around 1000m. The vineyard is close to Brangayne of Orange, and Peter Gibson says that Brangayne's success played a considerable part in his decision to plant the vineyard. Just over 1 ha of viognier and 1.6 ha of pinot noir (using the new Burgundy clones 777 115 and 114 in conjunction with MV6), plus a little riesling, have been added.
