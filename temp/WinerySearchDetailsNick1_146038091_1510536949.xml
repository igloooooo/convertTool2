            David and Dierdri Robertson-Cuninghame can trace their ancestry (via David) back to the Duke of Wellington, with Cuninghame Senior being the ADC to the Duke, and his son, Arthur Wellesley-Robertson, the godson. Arthur Wellesley migrated to Australia and took up the land upon which Wellington Vale is situated in 1839. Planting began in 1997 with 0.7 ha of semillon, 1 ha of pinot noir and 0.3 ha of riesling. The first vintage was in 2000, and subsequent vintages have won medals at the competitive Australian Small Winemakers Show.
