            Robyn and Peter Simmie planted 5.6ha of shiraz and 2.4ha of pinot noir in 1997 and 99. Initially the grapes were sold to Southcorp, but are now partly vinified for the Yuroke Vineyards label. It seems that I was indirectly responsible for the plantings of pinot (in preference to cabernet sauvignon), good advice at the time, but who knows what lies in the future. Not surprisingly, Shiraz is the wine that has received most accolades.
