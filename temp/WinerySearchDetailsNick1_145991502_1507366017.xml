            Kim and Jodie Espinos progressively established sauvignon blanc, shiraz and merlot between 1996 and 99 in the foothills of the Whicher Ranges, 15km inland from Busselton. Most of the grapes are sold, principally to Evans &amp; Tate; limited quantities are made under the Lone Crow label.
