            After 35 years as a general practitioner in Fremantle, Graeme Gargett and wife Lesley decided to ‘semi-retire’ and pursue a career in viticulture. They purchased their beautiful 35-ha property in the Scotsdale Valley in 1997. The north-facing slopes of well-drained karri loam soils were ideal for viticulture, and in 1999 they planted 4 ha of pinot noir, chardonnay, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. Most of the grapes are sold to Plantagenet, but small quantities have been made each year since 2002, some by Graeme Gargett without the use of preservatives. The Barking Dog label is in honour of the resident bird-scarer, the Gargetts’ dachshund Harley.
