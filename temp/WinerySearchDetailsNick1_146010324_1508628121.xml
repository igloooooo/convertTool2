            I simply cannot resist quoting directly from the background information kindly supplied to me. Piromit Wines is a relatively new boutique winery situated in Hanwood, NSW. The 1000-tonne capacity winery was built for the 1999 vintage on a 14-acre site which was until recently used as a drive-in. Previous to this, wines were made on our 100-acre vineyard. The winery site is being developed into an innovative tourist attraction complete with an Italian restaurant and landscaped formal gardens. It is safe to say this extends the concept of a boutique winery into new territory, but then it is a big country. Exports to Canada, Sweden and Italy.
