            This is the business of Ben Tyler and his father Peter, initially established on the family farm at Willung, but moving to a much larger unused facility in Rosedale (also in Gippsland) prior to the 2005 vintage. Ben graduated with a degree in Applied Science (Winemaking) from CSU; during his time at the university he was offered and accepted the position of trainee winemaker. The following year he was employed as assistant winemaker, before returning to Vic. In 2000 he became the winemaker at Clyde Park, producing a series of excellent wines over the following years. He now works full-time for Tyler Wines, developing the estate label, and also providing contract winemaking services for other clients.
