            Anthony Paul and Marian Dawson are busy people. In addition to establishing over 20ha of chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, they are in the process of opening a wine bar/restaurant in Robe, and intend to continue extending the vineyard on a further 16ha of plantable land. All of this is largely financed by the crayfishing boat which Anthony runs in the crayfish season.
