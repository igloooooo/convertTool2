            With 11.5ha of vines, a much-awarded winery restaurant, and lavender fields which help make unique wines, this is a business with something extra. There are a number of lavender wines, moving from sparkling through table to port, which have been infused with lavandula angustifolia. There is also a conventional estate range of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, made without lavender.
