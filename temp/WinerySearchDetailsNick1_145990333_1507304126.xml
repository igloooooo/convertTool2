            Jim Harrisons Lindenton Wines is a semi-retirement occupation. His business plan is based on the purchase of grapes from smaller growers in the region who do not have access to winemaking facilities or outlets for their fruit. From the word go there has been an extensive range of wines available, running through Verdelho, Chardonnay, Viognier, Marsanne, Merlot, Shiraz, Shiraz Viognier and top-of-the-tree Melange. Jims longer range plan is to make the wines himself.
