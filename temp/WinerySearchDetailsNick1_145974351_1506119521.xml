            Good Catholic Girl is the venture of Julie Ann Barry, one of the many children of the late Jim Barry. She says, Having been born into a Catholic wine family, in vintage, my fate was sealed. My Limerick Vineyard was planted in the Armagh area of the Clare Valley in 1997, with cuttings taken from my fathers famed Armagh shiraz vines planted across the paddock. The Shiraz is named The James Brazill, Jim Barrys Christian names. She takes up the story thus: In 2008 I made my first Clare Valley Riesling, Teresa, named after my mother, who is the true GCG (good catholic girl), and loves Clare Riesling, and who may in time consume my entire production of 108 dozen! 2011 dealt Julie a double blow with the loss of the fruit for the James Brazill Shiraz and the contract-grown Teresa Riesling. Exports to the US.
