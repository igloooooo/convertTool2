            The Honeytree Estate vineyard was first planted in 1970 and for a period of time wines were produced. It then disappeared, but the vineyard has since been revived by Dutch-born Henk Strengers and family. The vineyard includes semillon, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and a little clairette. Jancis Robinson comments that the wine tends to be very high in alcohol, a little low in acid and to oxidise dangerously fast, but in a sign of the times, the first Honeytree Clairette sold out so quickly (in four weeks) that 2.3ha of vineyard has been grafted over to clairette. Exports to The Netherlands.
