            Julian Castagna is an erudite and totally committed disciple of biodynamic grapegrowing and winemaking. He acknowledges that at least part of the belief in biodynamics has to be intuitive, while also seeking to understand and explain how and why the principles and practises enunciated by Rudolf Steiner in 1924 actually work. A recent move has been the purchase of two egg-shaped, food-grade concrete tanks, each holding 900 litres. They are, he says, the most perfect shape in physics, and in the winery reduce pressure on the lees and deposit the lees over a larger surface area, which, he believes, will eliminate the need for battonage. He has been joined by son Adam, who is responsible for the 400 dozen or so of Adams Rib made each year, complementing the production of Castagna. Exports to the UK, France, Spain, Denmark, Korea, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
