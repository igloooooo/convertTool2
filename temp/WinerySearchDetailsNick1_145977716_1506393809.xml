            The Heaslip family, headed by Marie Heaslip, son Anthony and wife Philippa Stansell, pooled their resources to buy the vineyard (planted to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and riesling) in 2004, after it had been on the market for some time. It is dry-grown, fertilised with organic fertilisers, all fungicides are organic, and no insecticides are used. The tough 07 vintage produced no grapes, but the organic approach, coupled with minimal use of tractors in the vineyard, is paying dividends. Anthony and Philippa live and work in the Northern Territory for most of the year, leaving management of the property to Marie. The wines are contract-made, up to 08 by Paulett Wines, and since 09 by Cardinham Estate. Exports to the US, Europe and NZ.
