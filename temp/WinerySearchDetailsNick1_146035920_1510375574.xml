            In 1997 Mark and Pippa Cumbers decided to leave Melbourne (where they had worked and become wine lovers) and return to Marks home state of WA. They chose a 4ha property on coastal tuart sands, and planted 0.5ha each of cabernet sauvignon, nebbiolo, sauvignon blanc, arneis, muscat a petit grains and chenin blanc. Nebbiolo was planted as a point of difference, but has so far proved as difficult to come to terms with here as elsewhere.
