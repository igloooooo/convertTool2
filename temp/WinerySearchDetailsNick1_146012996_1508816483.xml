            The Lakey family has established 5ha of pinot noir on their 230ha grazing property at an altitude of 400m. Initially the grapes were sold to Domaine Chandon, but in 1994 son John Lakey (who had gained experience at Tarrawarra, Rochford, Virgin Hills and Coonawarra, plus a vintage in Burgundy) began making the wine  and very competently.
