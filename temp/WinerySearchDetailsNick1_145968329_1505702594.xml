            Eumundi Vineyard is set on 21ha of river-front land in the beautiful Eumundi Valley, 12km from Noosa Heads. The climate is hot, wet, humid and maritime, the only saving grace being the regular afternoon northeast sea breeze. It is a challenging environment for growing grapes: the owners, Robyn and Gerry Humphrey, have trialled 14 different grape varieties and three different trellis systems. Currently they have shiraz, chambourcin and petit verdot. Part of the vineyard was sold, enabling the planting of German varieties regent and sirius. The establishment of the vineyard was financed by the sale of a 19m charter yacht that used to sail the oceans around northern Australia. Quite a change in lifestyle, but then Gerry Humphrey started his business life with a degree in veterinary science, a PhD in endocrinology, and ships masters ticket for coastal freighters. In 2008 he finished his winemaking studies at CSU, with yet another degree.
