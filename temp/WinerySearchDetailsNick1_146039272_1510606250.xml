            In 1998 the Baldwin family established a vineyard on northwest-facing slopes above the Coldstream aerodrome. Ross utilised his engineering background to meticulously plan and develop the project, whilst nurturing an ambition to grow the finest fruit possible. Most of the fruit is sold to a nearby winery, with a small select amount being retained for the Whitsend label. Exports to Canada, Japan, Indonesia and Hong Kong.
