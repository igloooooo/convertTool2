            When the Coopers started planting in the early 1980s there was scant knowledge of the best varieties for the region, let alone the Cobaw Ridge site. They have now settled on four varieties, chardonnay and syrah always being part of the mix. Lagrein and pinot noir are more recent arrivals to thrive; cabernet sauvignon (long ago) and vermentino (more recently) have been removed. In their place a close-planted, multi-clonal block of pinot noir, with a 1.25m  1.25m spacing, was established. Son Joshua has breezed through the wine science degree at Adelaide University with multiple distinctions; his immediate career has been with Tyrrells, then Heathcote Estate/Yabby Lake and thereafter winemaking in Domaine de la Vougeraie (Burgundy) courtesy of leading UK wine author Andrew Jeffords introduction, all in vintage 2012. Exports to Canada and China.
