            Bob and Marilyn Fowler purchased Kalgan River from founders John and Dianne Ciprian in early 2010. Kalgan River will remain an independent business from an operational viewpoint and will continue to be exclusively made from the mature vineyards (7 ha of shiraz, 5 ha cabernet sauvignon, 4 ha each of chardonnay and riesling and 1 ha of viognier). No red wines were produced in 2009 (damp growing season). Exports to the UK.
