            After several years overseas, former Melbourne professionals Peter and Lydia Snow returned in 1997 planning to open a wine tourism business in the Hunter Valley. However, they had second thoughts, and in 2000 moved to the Yarra Valley, where they have now established five B&amp;B cottages, a vineyard, and a cellar door outlet, backed by a constant temperature wine storage cool room. Exports to China.
