            Wattlebrook Vineyard was founded by NSW Supreme Court Justice Peter McClellan and family in 1994, with a substantial vineyard lying between the Wollemi National Park and Wollombi Brook. The family planted another major vineyard, in 1998, on Henry Lawson Drive at Mudgee, to shiraz, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. The Wollombi Vineyard is planted to chardonnay, semillon, verdelho, cabernet sauvignon and shiraz. The wines have been consistent medal winners at various local wine shows.
