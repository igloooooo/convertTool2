            In 1994 Phillip and Judy Cross began planting a vineyard on their 40ha property, situated on the old flood plains of the Angas River, which only flows after heavy rains in its catchment of the Adelaide Hills. With the assistance of son Jason they manage the property to minimise water use and maximise the accumulation of organic matter. Skilled contract winemaking has resulted in some excellent wines from the estate-grown shiraz (14ha), cabernet sauvignon (10ha) and chardonnay (1.2ha).  Exports to China.
