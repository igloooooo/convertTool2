            Mark Walpole and partner Carolyn De Poi began the development of their Aquila Audax Vineyard in 1997, planting the first vines. It is situated between 530 and 580m above sea level: the upper-eastern slopes are planted to pinot noir and the warmer western slopes to cabernet sauvignon; there are also small quantities of shiraz, tempranillo, sangiovese and merlot.
