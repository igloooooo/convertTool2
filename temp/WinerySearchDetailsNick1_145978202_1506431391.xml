            Henley Park, like so many Swan Valley wineries, was founded by a Yugoslav family, but it is now jointly owned by Danish and Malaysian interests, a multicultural mix if ever there was one. Majority owner (with wife Lisbet) and winemaker Claus Petersen arrived in 1986. The estate plantings are a patchwork quilt of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, semillon, chenin blanc, chardonnay and muscat gordo blanco in tiny quantities. Exports to Denmark and Singapore.
