            Step Rd is home to both the Step Rd and Beresford ranges of wines. Fruit is primarily sourced from Adelaide Hills, Langhorne Creek, McLaren Vale and the Riverland. In a sign of the times, it is an environmentally aware winery: all liquid waste is stored in plastic-lined dams, treated to remove chemicals and salinity and then recycled as irrigation for the vineyard. All solid waste from the grapes (skins, stalks and seeds) is mulched and returned to the vineyards, reducing irrigation requirements by 25%. In December 2011, Step Rd went into receivership with several million dollars owed to creditors, and the 5000-tonne capacity winery, brands (including Step Rd, Beresford and Trig Point), and bulk and bottled wine stock were put on the market, and in April 2012 were acquired by VOK Beverages.
