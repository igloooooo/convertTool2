            East Arm Vineyard was established by Launceston gastroenterologist Dr John Wettenhall and partner Anita James, who has completed the CSU Diploma in Applied Science (wine growing). The 2ha vineyard, which came into full production in 1998, is more or less equally divided among riesling, chardonnay and pinot noir. It is established on a historic block, part of a grant made to retired British soldiers of the Georgetown garrison in 1821, and slopes down to the Tamar River. East Arm has been sold, but details are not yet available.
