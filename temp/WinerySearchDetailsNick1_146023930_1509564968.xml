            St Brioc Wines is a collaboration between sisters Jo Madigan and Trish Wenk and their families. The name comes from the property where the girls spent their early years, further supported by the Celtic symbol dedicated to St Brioc, the Inchbrayok Cross that provided the inspiration for the logo and label.
