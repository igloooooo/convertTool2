            In a region noted for its spectacular scenery, Samson Hill Estate has been established by Steven and Pago Sampson on one of the most spectacular sites of all. At the very top of Kangaroo Ground, it looks to the city of Melbourne (with the buildings clearly visible), thence to Kinglake and the Dandenongs, and then all the way to Mt Macedon. They have planted 3ha of pinot noir, 2ha of verdelho and 0.5ha of shiraz, the verdelho firmly aimed at the cellar door market. The cellar door restaurant offers catering for all functions, one of the few winery restaurants in the Yarra Valley to be open weeknights for dinner.
