            Stonehurst Cedar Creek has been established by Daryl and Phillipa Heslop on a historic 220ha property in the Wollombi Valley, underneath the Pokolbin Range. The vineyards (chambourcin, semillon, chardonnay and shiraz) are organically grown. A substantial part of the business, however, is the six self-contained cottages on the property. Skilled contract winemaking has produced great results. Exports to all major markets.
