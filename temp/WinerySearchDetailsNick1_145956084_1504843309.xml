            Tim Anstey and Helen Lacey acquired their north-sloping property 2km from the St Vincent Gulf after Tims retirement from university teaching. The choice of region was driven by Dr John Gladstones enthusiasm for the mild, maritime climate of the lower Fleurieu Peninsula, suiting red grapes in particular. In 2001 they planted 1ha of shiraz and 0.8ha of cabernet sauvignon, followed later by 0.7ha of chardonnay and 0.2ha of viognier. The purpose-built hillside cellar door has spectacular views of both the coast and surrounding hills. Tim Geddes calls the shots with the winemaking; Tim Anstey is cellar hand.
