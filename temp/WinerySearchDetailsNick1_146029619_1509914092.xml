            The brand names of The Colonial Estate wines tell part of the story: Exile, Emigre, Exodus, Explorateur, Etranger, Envoy, Expatrie, Evangeliste and Enchanteur. It will come as no surprise, then, to find that this is a French-managed business with an extensive export program to many parts of the world including France and other European countries. Thoroughly European winemaking methods are used, most obviously being two sorting tables, one for the bunches before they pass through the de-stemmer, and another for individual berries after the de- stemming process. The company runs an active membership program for direct sales. Offered for sale by receivers at the time of going to press.
