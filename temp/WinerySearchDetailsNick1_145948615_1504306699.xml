            Peter Polson is now the sole owner of Bent Creek, which has acquired a second 5-ha vineyard at McLaren Vale. As a parallel development, Tim Geddes is now assisting Peter in the winemaking. In 2009 it opened a new cellar door and barrel storage facility ( just across the road from the prior facility). On the other side of the coin, heat and drought have made inroads, and no chardonnay was picked in â€™09; even the 50-year-old vines have suffered greatly.
