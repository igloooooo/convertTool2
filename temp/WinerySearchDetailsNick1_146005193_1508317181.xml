            Kevin and Helen Olssen first visited the Clare Valley in 1986. Within two weeks they and their family decided to sell their Adelaide home and purchased a property in a small, isolated valley 3km north of the township of Watervale. As a result of the acquisition of the Bass Hill Vineyard, estate plantings have risen to almost 32ha, including unusual varieties such as carmenere and primitivo di Gioia. The business is a joint venture involving Kevin and children David and Jane Olssen, Helen having passed away in 2010. Exports to Hong Kong and China.
