            Owners Bruce and Jo-Anne Lang have combined professional careers and small-scale winemaking for over 30 years. In the early 1970s they gained vacation employment with Yarra Valley wineries, and at the end of that decade they joined with friends in acquiring the old Brown Brothers Everton Hills vineyard near Beechworth. In 1987 they acquired their property adjacent to Yeringberg, overlooking Domaine Chandon, beginning the establishment of the vineyard in 89, and extending it in 96. With a total of 2.9ha of pinot noir, chardonnay, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, it is small, and until 2002 all of the grapes were sold to two major Yarra Valley wineries. Since then 50% of the grapes have been used for the Finestra label.
