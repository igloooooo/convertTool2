            Ian Bell started his career as a cellar and vineyard hand at Moss Wood; he was encouraged to study viticulture at the then Roseworthy College in 1987, and returned in 89 to work for Moss Wood. Between 1990 and 99 he established cabernet sauvignon (3.5ha), merlot, petit verdot and malbec (0.5ha each) on the Glenmore property, which has been in the familys ownership since 1895. Between 1997 and 2001 all of the grapes were sold to Moss Wood and made under the Glenmore Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon label. Since then, Ian has developed the Glenmore label in its own right, but continues to sell grapes to Moss Wood, the wine now being called Amys Vineyard, named after Ians grandmother Amy Beers who owned and ran beef cattle into her eighties. Exports to the UK.
