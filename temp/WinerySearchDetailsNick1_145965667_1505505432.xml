            The improbable name is a typically whimsical invention of the three proprietors: Donny is contributed by Stuart Gregor, whose marketing and PR prowess has hitherto prevented an entry for the venture in the Wine Companion. Kate Goodman is the (genuinely) good part of the team, while Cameron MacKenzie is the mac. Kate and Cameron both work full-time at Punt Road, where Kate is chief winemaker. What started as a little bit of fun in 2002 (less than 50 dozen made) has grown to the dizzy heights of 600 dozen, utilising old-vine shiraz from the Pyrenees, and chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon from a couple of old vineyards in the Coldstream area of the Yarra Valley.
