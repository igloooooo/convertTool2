            Heritage Farm claims to be the only vineyard and orchard in Australia still using horsepower, with Clydesdales used for most of the general farm work. The winery and cellar door area also boasts a large range of restored horse-drawn farm machinery and a bottle collection. Wines are sold by mailing list and through the cellar door.
