            When Cindy and John Cahill purchased a former 66ha dairy farm in 1996 with the intention of planting a vineyard. John worked for Lindemans for 13 years in Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns, and developed marketing skills from this experience. Nonetheless, they have hastened slowly, planting shiraz (in 1998) and chardonnay (in 2000). They make the Shiraz onsite; the Unwooded Chardonnay is processed at Crane Winery.
