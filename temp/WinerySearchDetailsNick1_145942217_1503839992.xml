            Sarah Fletcher came to Alta with an impressive winemaking background: a degree from Roseworthy, and thereafter seven years working for Orlando Wyndham. There she came face to face with grapes from all over Australia, and developed a particular regard for those coming from the Adelaide Hills. So she joined Alta, which had already established a reputation for its Sauvignon Blanc. The portfolio has been progressively extended with varieties suited to the cool climate of the Adelaide Hills. Exports to the UK, Canada and Hong Kong.
