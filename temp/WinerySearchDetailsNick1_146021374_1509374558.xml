            This is the venture of Judith Firkin, Gordon and Julian Leckie, who between 1975 and 95 planted shiraz (4.25ha) and chardonnay (0.75ha). The vineyard is located on the southern and eastern slopes of She Oak Hill, 6km north of Heathcote. It lies between Jasper Hill, Emilys Paddock and Mt Ida vineyards, and thus has the same type of porous, deep red Cambrian soil. The decision to opt for dry-grown vines has meant low yields. Lower than usual alcohol level is a feature of the wines, which have won a number of wine show medals.
