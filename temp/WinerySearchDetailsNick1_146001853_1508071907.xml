            Andy and Melinda Murdock purchased Murdup in 1996, retaining the name of the property which was first settled for grazing in the 1860s. They began by planting 10.5ha of vineyard, the lions share going to cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, with smaller patches of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, most of the wine going to the UK. Ten years later they dramatically upped the ante by purchasing the Mildara Black Wattle Vineyard across the road, lifting their vineyards to 65 ha. The also commenced reworking portions of the newly acquired vineyard, removing 6ha of poorly performing shiraz, replacing it with equal quantities of sauvignon blanc and pinot gris. They have also substantially upped their wine marketing, and introduced a second label, Soaring Kite. Exports to the UK.
