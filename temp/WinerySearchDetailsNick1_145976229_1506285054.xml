            Mark Hamilton, an Adelaide lawyer by profession, is a sixth-generation direct descendant of Richard Hamilton, who arrived in SA in 1838 (a year after the State was proclaimed) and made his first wine in 1841. Hamiltons Ewell Vineyards remained in the family until 1979, when it was acquired by Mildara Blass, much to Mark's dismay. Since 1991 he has set about building another Hamilton wine business by a series of astute vineyard acquisitions, and by buying back the name Hamiltons Ewell from Mildara. Most of the grapes are sold, but there is scope to increase production.
