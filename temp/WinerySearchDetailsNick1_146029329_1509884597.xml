            Terra Felix was for many years a brand of Tallarook Wines, jointly owned by the Riebl family and by Peter Simon, Stan Olszewski and John Nicholson. In 2005 it was decided to separate the businesses, with Luis Riebl now solely concerned with the production of the Tallarook wines. Peter and Stan had run the Stanley Wine Company in Clare over 20 years ago, leaving it in the early 1980s, but always harboured a desire to be involved in the industry as owners. Grapes continue to be sourced from Tallarook and are supplemented by other local growers. They have worked hard to establish export markets as well as on-premise distribution in Australia, with one-third of the production exported to India and China.
