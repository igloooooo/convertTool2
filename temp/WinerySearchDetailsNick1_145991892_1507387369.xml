            Previously known as Eastbrook Estate, Lost Lakes origins go back to 1990, to the acquisition of an 80ha farming property which was subdivided into three portions: 16 ha, now known as Picardy, were acquired by Dr Bill Pannell, 18ha became the base for Lost Lake, and the remainder was sold. The initial plantings in 1990 were of pinot noir and chardonnay, followed by shiraz, sauvignon blanc, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. A jarrah and cedar winery with a crush capacity of 150 tonnes was built in 95, together with a large restaurant. Steve and Karen Masters acquired the property in 2006 and moved from Perth to live there full-time.
