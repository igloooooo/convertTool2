            The vineyards at Gawler River Grove go back to the late 1940s, with 7.7ha of grenache bush vines. Since then, 5.8ha of chardonnay and 1.5ha of shiraz have been added. It was not until 2003 that a small amount of Chardonnay was vinified for the Gawler River Grove label; Grenache followed in 04.
