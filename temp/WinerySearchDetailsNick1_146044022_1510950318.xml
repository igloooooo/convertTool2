            David and Julie Gardiner began the establishment of their 17-ha vineyard in 1998, with all but 2 ha planted in that year. Verdelho, chardonnay, semillon, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc are in production; the 2000 plantings of riesling and zinfandel produced their first grapes in 2003.
