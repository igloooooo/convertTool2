            Koorooba has been home to the Reid family since the 1860s, and when the decision was taken in 1997 to establish a vineyard, three generations were involved: Max, Peter and Ben Reid. Ben and Janice Reid have since developed the 3.6-ha vineyard planted to sauvignon blanc, semillon, verdelho, grenache, shiraz, mataro, petit verdot and tempranillo. The slightly quaint name comes from John Traill, Tenterfieldâ€™s first doctor, whose nose was apparently reminiscent of the dominant rocky mountain on the western horizon of the property.
