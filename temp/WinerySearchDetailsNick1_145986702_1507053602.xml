            Dairy farmers Phil and Jane Gray decided to diversify with the establishment of a 4ha vineyard on part of their farm. They have planted 1.3ha each of chardonnay and pinot noir, and 0.7ha each of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon (and a few pinot gris and viognier vines) on a northeasterly slope, bordered on the east by a 2.4ha lake. As well as their general farming background, they have undertaken various CSU grape and wine production courses, and similar short courses from other education facilities. A simple but appropriately equipped winery has been established, and the wines are sold through local stores and restaurants. The name is believed to be the word for kookaburra in the language of the local Kurnai people.
