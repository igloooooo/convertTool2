            Sheep’s Back is a joint venture between Neil Empson (with 30 years’ experience as an exporter to Australia and elsewhere of Italian wines) and Dean Hewitson. They decided to produce a single estate-grown shiraz after an extensive search found a vineyard of 75-year-old shiraz. With Dean at the helm of winemaking and with Neil’s input on style, the aim is to produce a wine that is not overwhelmed by alcohol or oak, but that reflects the varietal aspects of this essency, old vine shiraz. Temporarily in hiatus, no wines currently available.
