            Cardinham Estate was founded by Fred Dinham as a single 24ha vineyard in 1981. Now known as the Home Block, continuous improvement and land availability has seen the vineyards expand to 50ha. Noel Smith and wife Heather moved to Clare to run the vineyards, eventually living on the Home Block. With falling grape prices and an oversupply of the wrong varieties, things were very tight, but hard work prevailed and the rewards were realised when Noel was able to purchase more land and sons Scott and Shane returned to help. By the 1990s the whole family was involved in the venture, which now includes the Stradbrooke, Russ Block and Carters vineyards. Their work was rewarded when they won three trophies at the Canberra International Riesling Challenge 09, including the coveted Best Riesling in the World Trophy (for the 03 Riesling), the first awarded to an Australian winery.  Exports to the US, Hong Kong and China.
