            The Wily Trout vineyard, owned by Robert and Susan Bruce, shares its home with the Poachers Pantry, a renowned gourmet smokehouse. The quality of the wines is very good, and a testament to the skills of the contract winemakers. The northeast-facing slopes, at an elevation of 720m, provide some air drainage and hence protection against spring frosts. The production increase (from 3000 dozen) speaks for itself.
