            Victor Harbors first winery was established in 1991 by Adrienne and Neville Scott in the picturesque Southern Fleurieu Peninsula Hills behind Victor Harbour. Planting of a 4ha vineyard to serve the winery commenced in 1992. The first wine from cabernet sauvignon and shiraz was produced in 1996 and the cellar door opened in 99. The '09 vintage was destroyed by the heatwave following three years of drought, the '10 was much better.
