            The Dexter (Todd and Debbie) and Bird (Ian and Ruth, David and Marie) families have been making or selling wine for 30 years. They were holidaying in the pictuesque vineyards and ancient Bastide villages of southwest France when they decided to do something new that was all about fun: fun for them, and fun for the consumers who bought their wines with a distinctive southern French feel to them. Thus the first two wines are a Viognier Chardonnay, and a Dolcetto Shiraz. The prices are also friendly, at $17-20 a bottle, bistros one of the target markets. Exports to the UK.
