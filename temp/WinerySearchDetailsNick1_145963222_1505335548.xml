            James and Jody Dawson own and manage this vineyard at the southern end of the Yarra Valley, planted to chardonnay and pinot noir. The climate here is particularly cool, and the grapes do not normally ripen until late April. Jody has completed a degree in viticulture through CSU. The tiny hand-crafted production (Chardonnay and Pinot Noir) is sold through local restaurants and cellars in the Olinda/Emerald/Belgrave area.
