            Wagga Wagga residents Gerry McCormick and partner Sue Limberger are the owners of a 40ha property on undulating land on the southwest slopes of the Great Dividing Range. In 2002 they commissioned a detailed analysis of soil structure on the property, and after sampling 12 pits at various sites, their consultant confirmed that the decomposed granite soil had an ideal structure and neutral pH suited to the production of premium grapes. In October 2002 they entered into a handshake agreement with John Casella to buy the grapes from the shiraz and chardonnay vines, which were planted the following month. With only 2ha of each variety planted, it was a drop in the ocean for Casella and yellow tail, and the partners now retain the grapes. A new winery, cellar door and function centre have also been built on the site.
