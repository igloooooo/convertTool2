            Karen and the late Malcolm Orrock (and their family) began the establishment of the vineyard in 1997, and have progressively established shiraz, sangiovese, cabernet sauvignon, grenache, tempranillo and petit verdot. The bulk of the production is sold to Peter Lehmann Wines, with limited amounts made for sale under the Remarkable View brand, the interesting label of which is a grape vine leaf with the image of a Clydesdale horses head within the veins of the leaf.
