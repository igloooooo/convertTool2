            In March 2008 the Redman family celebrated 100 years of winemaking in Coonawarra. The 08 vintage also marked the arrival of Daniel as the fourth-generation Redman winemaker. Daniel gained winemaking experience in Central Victoria, the Barossa Valley and the US before taking up his new position. It was felicitous timing, for the 04 Cabernet Sauvignon and 04 Cabernet Merlot were each awarded a gold medal from the national wine show circuit in 07, the first such accolades for a considerable time. The quality has stabilised at a level in keeping with the long-term history of the winery and its mature vines.
