            Hermann Fehr, a renowned architect, and wife Regula, a retail business owner, left Zurich, Switzerland in 1982 to make their home in Australia. After seven months travelling they acquired an 80ha property near Denmark, built their home, began raising cattle, and built three self-contained holiday units. In 2000 they planted a small vineyard with pinot noir, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, making the first vintage in 04, bringing Angelo Scifoni in as partner in the winemaking business.
