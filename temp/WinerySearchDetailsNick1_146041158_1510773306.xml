            Justin and Donna Burman purchased their property in the beautiful Bundaleer Forest, in the Southern Flinders Ranges region. A second reason for purchasing the property was a tree change for their young family in a renovated cottage on the site. They planted shiraz in 2000, and also 1700 olive trees. The name came from their young son Toms vigilance when he saw a wallaby sheltering in the shade, and called out,Theres a wobbly in the vines.
