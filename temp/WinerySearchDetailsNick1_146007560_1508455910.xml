            The Osicka family arrived in Australia from Czechoslovakia in the early 1950s. Vignerons in their own country, they settled at Graytown and commenced planting vines in 55. Their vineyard was the first new venture in Central and Southern Victoria for over half a century. With the return of Simon Osicka to the family business, there have been substantial changes. Prior to joining the family business full-time in 2010, Simon had senior winemaking positions at Houghton, Leasingham and as group red winemaker for Constellation Wines Australia, interleaved with vintages in Italy, Canada, Germany and France, working at the prestigious Domaine J.L. Chave in Hermitage for the 10 vintage. The fermentation of the red wines has been changed from static to open fermenters, and French oak has replaced American oak.
