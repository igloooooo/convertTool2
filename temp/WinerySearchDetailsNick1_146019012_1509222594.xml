            Owners Vince and Tina Scaffidi have sold their interest in the 80ha Gumeracha Vineyards, but have retained 2.2ha of sauvignon blanc and chardonnay at their Gumeracha house property. They also have 99ha on their One Tree Hill Vineyard, planted to shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, sangiovese, nebbiolo, petit verdot and chardonnay, the majority of the grape production being sold. The cellar door and restaurant is named Talunga Cellars. The wines are exceptionally well priced.
