            Mark Hill and wife Helen acquired their property in 1998. At that time it had 5 ha of chardonnay, and in the spring of 1999 the plantings were extended with 2 ha each of verdelho, merlot, chambourcin, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. Sustainable viticultural practices are used, and no insecticides are applied.
