            Andrew Pirie has had a lifetime of experience growing grapes and making wine in northern Tasmania. He established Pipers Brook Vineyard in 1974, and was responsible for making it the best-known Tasmanian winery in the 1980s and much of the ’90s, before he relinquished what was then part-ownership. The cellar door is now located at the spectacularly situated Rosevears Vineyard, which is also home to Estelle Restaurant, with its panoramic views over the Tamar River. Some will no doubt find it ironic that one of Rosevears’ attractions is said to be eco-retreats. This is peripheral to the quality of the wines, which has always been very good. Exports to the UK, the US and other major markets.
