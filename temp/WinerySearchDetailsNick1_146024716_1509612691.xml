            Statford Park is situated in the triangle bounded by Robertson 5 km east, Burrawang 5 km to the northwest and Wildes Meadow, some 6 km southwest. The Wildes Meadow Creek rises in the northeastern end of the valley, runs east-west through to Lake Fitzroy a few kms further west. In 1997/8, 6500 vines were planted, the first wine release following in '01. The cellar door has an exotic array of lavender and other products.
