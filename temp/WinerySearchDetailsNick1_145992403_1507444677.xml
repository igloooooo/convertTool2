            Macquariedale is an acorn to oak story, beginning with a small hobby vineyard in Branxton many years ago, and now extending to three certified organic (in conversion) vineyards around the Hunter with semillon, chardonnay, pinot noir, shiraz, merlot, mataro and cabernet sauvignon. This has led to Ross McDonald (and family) leaving a busy Sydney life to be full-time grapegrower and winemaker. Exports to Canada, Japan and China.
