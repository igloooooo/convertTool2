            This is the realisation of owner/winemaker Kate Morgans dream of making her own wine with her own label. After graduating from Curtin University with a degree in viticulture and oenology she worked vintages in Australia (including Coriole,Tamar Ridge and Coldstream Hills) and overseas (Archery Summit, California, and Quinta do Noval, Portugal), before returning to WA. There she worked at Houghton, Stella Bella and for the last three years as assistant winemaker at Fraser Gallop Estate. The wines are made with minimal additions (only SO2 added), and are wild-fermented.
