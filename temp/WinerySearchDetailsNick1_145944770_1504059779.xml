            Graeme and Pip Roberts, long-time residents of Tasmania, ventured into wine later in life than many. Graeme is a retired civil engineer, Pip a registered nurse, who moved to Bagdad from Hobart. The vineyard is predominantly planted to pinot noir, with smaller amounts of sauvignon blanc, riesling and shiraz. The vineyard has been managed biodynamically since planting began in 2001, and Graeme is on the Council of Biodynamics Tasmania.
