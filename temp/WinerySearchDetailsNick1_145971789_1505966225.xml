            Gecko Valley extends the viticultural map of Qld yet further: it is little more than 50km off the Tropic of Capricorn in an area better known for beef farming and mineral activities. The vineyard was established by Tony (an engineer) and Coleen McCray (an accountant). The coastal belt between Gladstone and Rockhampton has a unique climate, with lower rainfall than the more northern and the more southern coastal strips. The climate is hot, but the vineyard is only 1km from the tempering influence of the sea. Equal quantities of chardonnay, verdelho and shiraz have been planted on free-draining, shallow soil, so excessive vigour is not a problem.
