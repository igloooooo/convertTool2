            This venture of former Balgownie winemaker Lindsay Ross and wife Noeline is part of a broader business known as Winedrops, which acts as a wine production and distribution network for the Bendigo wine industry. The Knots wines are sourced from long-established vineyards, providing shiraz (4ha), malbec (0.5ha) and viognier (0.25ha). The viticultural accent is on low-cropping, with concentrated flavours, the winemaking emphasis on flavour, finesse and varietal expression.
