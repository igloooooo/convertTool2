            Charlie and Ivka Javor started Chestnut Hill with small plantings of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and pinot noir in 1985 and have slowly increased the vineyards to a little over 3 ha. Less than an hours drive from Melbourne, the picturesque vineyard is situated among the rolling hills in the Dandenongs near Mt Burnett. The label explains, Liberty is a gift we had never experienced in our homeland, Croatia, from which they emigrated in the late 1960s.
