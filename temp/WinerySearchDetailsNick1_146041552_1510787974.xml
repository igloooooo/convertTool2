            Wood Block is the venture of Tim and Sarah Kidman, a family name that resonates in Coonawarra and in the minds of those who know the history of the eponymous cattle-grazing family. Tim was only three years old when his maternal grandfather, Grant Wood, first planted shiraz on the terra rossa soil. He and Sarah are now the third generation to care for the vineyard, which now comprises cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and viognier. Only a small part of the production is vinified under the Wood Block Wines label by the infinitely experienced Peter Douglas.
