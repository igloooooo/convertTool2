            With a background as an engineer and having dabbled in home winemaking for 30 years, Colin (and Chris) Best took the plunge and moved into commercial winemaking in 1998. His wines are found in a whos who of restaurants, and in some of the best independent wine retailers on the east coast. Colin says,I consider that my success is primarily due to the quality of my grapes (2.25ha of pinot noir, 0.5ha of chardonnay), since they have been planted on a 1.2m  1.2m spacing and very low yields. The business continued to grow, with contract-grown grapes coming from here, there and everywhere. In 2008 the Bests took over the former Spur Creek winery, with a consequent move of cellar door. Michael Fogarty (together with partner Dr Diana Hodge and her brother David), with a track record as chief winemaker at Tamar Ridge (0105), then Nepenthe (0608) purchased Leabrook Estate from Colin and Chris Best in early 11. Exports to the UK.
