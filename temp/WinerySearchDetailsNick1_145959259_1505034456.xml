            Christmas Hill is primarily a grapegrower, selling most of its production from the 13ha of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, but keeping back the equivalent of around 2000 dozen Sauvignon Blanc. It is primarily sold to Adelaide Cellar Door (www.adelaidecellardoor.com.au), by the case through Christmas Hills mailing list, with a dribble finding its way onto the Adelaide retail market. Exports to the US, Sweden and Hong Kong.
